How much you can tolerate, so long
Oh yeahhhhh, my ass.....
Rewind the days of film
To pretend that it is not painful
It hurts to hurt
To get used to your handwriting
Above the sky is your Highness
Dying for two
Between these lines
Huy Huy
Give me your hand Lady
I want you to go mad
Paradise will be on the planet
I have lead you there
Hay, come together potantsuem
After all, you, like air, I now need
I will make an infinite
The best that was you
