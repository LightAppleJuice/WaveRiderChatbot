Well, Ive seen you before on the discoteque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
Oh, but I could it swore that I saw something more in your eyes
Altho' you were surrounded by beauty unbounded
In a grandess intended for me
And tho I try to hid it I found myself lookin to see

So, then you took your chances your major advances
Your touch took my breathe away
But when you said hello are you ready to go
Well I had just one thing to say

If you can't give me love
Honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with
Old fashioned meanings
Then Just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love, love

Well, you maybe the king of this discoteque thing
But honey, I aint looking for that
What I need is a man, not some so called aristocrat

Oh if only you'd waited and just hesitated
Or maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know why I don't wanna go
Well baby, that's why we don't stand a chance

So if you can't give me love
Honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
Old fashioned meanings
Then Just stay in love with yourself

Oh, if you can't give me love
Honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
And If you can't give me feelings
With Old fashioned meanings
Then Just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love
Honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
With Old fashioned meanings
Then Just stay in love with yourself
