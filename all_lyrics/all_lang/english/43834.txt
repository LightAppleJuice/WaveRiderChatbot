I'm like a strange cat running in the heat of the night
I've got a fire in my eyes, got a date with delight
Some kinda moaning in in the heart of the storm
I'm gonna love you so hard, you'll want your loving done
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you

With my one hand loose I aim to satisfy
You like my loving machine - I like your bloodshot eye
Real gone girl, jumping back with the beat
I'll be your tall cool one with the crazy feet
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you 

I'm so tall and you're so cute
Let's play wild like wildcats do
You're gonna rock your tall cool one
I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that

You stroll, you jump, you're hot and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one and I'm built to please
You stroll, you jump, you're hot and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one and I'm built to please

(Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you 

Move over mister - step on back in the crowd
'Cause she's a whole lotta sister 'bout to drive me wild
Lotta places I've been, lotta names, lotta words
No one compares to my real gone girl
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you 

I'm so tall and you're so cute 

You stroll, you jump 

(Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you
