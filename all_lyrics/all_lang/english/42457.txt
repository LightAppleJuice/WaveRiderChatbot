My hunger hurts yeah, my heart is starving 
the old animal in me is shining again. 
He is sneaking around the way, oh, yeah, 
Trying to free himself from the cage. 

O, love, how I wish I could stay, but my heart is starving 
The old sailor in me is shining again. 
He is at the harbor cursing inside of his skin 
He is waiting, waiting for a ship to carry him away.
