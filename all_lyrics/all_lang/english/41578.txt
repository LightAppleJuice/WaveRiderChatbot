Midnight, gettin uptight, where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to 2.
I know I'm hangin but I'm still wantin you
Hey, Jack- it's a fact they're talkin in town
I turn my back and you're messin around.
I'm not really jealous- dont like lookin like a clown.

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away...

I hate myself for loving you,
Can't break free from the things that you do.
I wanna walk but I run back to you
Thats why I hate myself for lovin you.

Daylight spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through

Hey man bet you can treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see your face and say forget it just from spite

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away...

I hate myself....for loving you
