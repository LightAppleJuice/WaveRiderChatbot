Holy Moses met the Pharaoh
Yeah, he tried to set him straight
Looked him in the eye
Let my people go
Holy Moses on the mountain
High above the golden calf
Went to get the Ten Commandments
Yeah, he's just gonna break them in half!

{Refrain}
All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you

No one ever spoke to Noah
They all laughed at him instead
Working on his ark
Working all by himself
Only Noah saw it coming
Forty days and forty nights
Took his sons and daughters with him
Yeah, they were the Israelites

{Refrain}
All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you

Holy Father, what's the matter
Where have all your children gone
Sitting in the dark, living all by themselves
You don't have to hide any more

{Refrain, except:}
All you zombies show your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you

All you zombies show your faces, I know you're out there
All you people in the street, let's see you
All you sittin' in high places
It's all gonna fall on you
