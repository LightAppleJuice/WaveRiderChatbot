Ok, where the hell you been? (huh?)
Said that you'd been hanging with your cute girlfriend
Then I get a call, kinda woke me up
Said that they saw you chillin' with this young little fuck (what?)

I was kinda dazed and maybe confused,
Never woulda expected this terrible news,
Not only were you kissing this fool you been dissin'
You was playing me out
Now you better listen

What the f*ck is going on?
Who the f*ck do you think you are? (B*tch!)
Cause for alarm
Gonna put your shit begging me to stay

Even though you run your f*ckin' mouth everyday!
I ain't some punk a*s dealing with your drunk as*
Sure your mighty fine
But you crossed the f*ckin' line

Now there's no returnin'
This lesson that your learnin'
Pulling down your panties
And leave your ass burnin'

[Chorus]
Cause I deserve more
I deserve more
You act like a wh*re
So just drop dead
Just drop dead

Rewind
Back to the start (Go)
When we got together I gave you my heart
You made a few mistakes
But that's how it goes

And every time I broke up you gave my a*s a rose (aww)
Saying that your sorry
And I'm the only one
Believed you like a chump

While you were having fun
I was feelin' lonely
While you were with your hommie
Ain't that a b*tch?
Now your boy can blow me

What the f*ck is going on?
Who the f*ck do you think you are? (B*tch!)
Cause for alarm
Gonna put your shit begging me to stay

Even though you run your f*ckin' mouth everyday!
I ain't some punk a*s dealing with your drunk a*s
Sure your mighty fine
But you crossed the f*ckin' line

Now there's no returnin'
This lesson that your learnin'
Pulling down your panties
And leave your a*s burnin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I deserve more
I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead

There's love
There's lust
Then blood
Then guts

Your touch
My crutch
I trust you way too much

There's love
There's lust
Then blood
Then guts

Your touch
My crutch
I trust you way too much

You gotta lotta f*ckin' nerve!
Ya think this is a f*ckin' tennis match? (B*tch!)
Time for me to serve
I'm John Mackinroe

Ready for me ho?
Its 15-love
Where the f*ck you gonna go? (Huh?)
Where the f*ck you gonna go? (Huh?)
Where the f*ck you gonna go?

What the f*ck is going on?
Who the f*ck do you think you are? (B*tch!)
Cause for alarm
Gonna put your sh*t begging me to stay

Even though you run your f*ckin' mouth everyday!
I ain't some punk a*s dealing with your drunk a*s
Sure your mighty fine
But you crossed the f*ckin' line

Now there's no returnin'
This lesson that your learnin'
Pulling down your panties
And leave your a*s burnin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I deserve more
I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead
