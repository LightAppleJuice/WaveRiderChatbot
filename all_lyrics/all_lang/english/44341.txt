Okay, you caused yourself dome grief and that’s alright
The only way for you is to fight

You’ve crossed the line you damaged your mind
Cause all the time you sit and watch the tube
With bats in the belfry look what’s happened to you

Oh well, your whole entire world is filled with pain
Can you try to walk without a cane and stay sane?

Against the wall you’re ready to fall
Cause all and all you don’t know what to do
With bats in the belfry look what’s happened to you

Don’t you know your life’s obscured
And you know it can’t be cured
You’re all alone
Pick up the phone
There’s no one home
For you to call

You’ve crossed the line you damaged your mind
Cause all the time you sit and watch the tube
With bats in the belfry look what’s happened to you

Against the wall you’re ready to fall
Cause all and all you don’t know what to do
With bats in the belfry look what’s happened to you

Look what’s happened to you

You’ve fallen off the edge of your mind
