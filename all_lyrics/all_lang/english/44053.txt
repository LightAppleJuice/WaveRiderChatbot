Darkness grows, in my mind...
Fear erases the memories

The past is gone, in my mind...
Courage releases unknown tales

Dreams appear, in my mind...
Shadow covers reality

There is a place no sound and no ground
This is where I free my grief

Things are never seen before or heard before
The times has come, the music is almost begun

"The gates of dream lie waiting as you see
There's not much to say just follow me
I can take your broken soul from here
You know your soul can not be free"

Welcome darkness, my restless friend
I am going to fly one last more
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained...
Opened my eyes but I can not see
What is being done to me?
