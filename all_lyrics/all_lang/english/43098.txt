All these words you speak to me are from a foreign land
You're telling me that birds don't fly
How can it be that you love her
You don't have to raise your voice, I still don't understand
There's me and you, and you and me
So how can it be that you love her?

It was alchemy to sing to me your freedom song
To make love where there was none
Alchemy, now it's all gone
She is the golden one

So what are you saying, we've got to dismantle it all

Rip off the paper, smash up the walls, how can it be that you love her?
Take all of the things we so carefully made
Take all of the life that you've betrayed
How can it be that you love her

It was alchemy to sing to me your freedom song
To make love where there was none
Alchemy, now it's all gone
She is the golden one
