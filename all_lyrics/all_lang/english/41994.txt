You got that dance
You got that mobile drum
You got that whiskey cupboard

You got that gaze
You got those magic shoes
You got that hickey covered

You do that walk
You got that masterplan
You do that vowel tuck-in

You got that voice
You got that ignorance
You got that lack of good use

And when the sun goes down my friend
And we’re going souther once again

This time I’ll let you come along
Cause you know just what to do
This time I’ll let you come along
Cause I need somebody new

I want some sun
I need some action man
I want some recreation

You want some speed
You need some ocean burn
You want some kisses static.

I got my time
I got my whole sunshine
I got my mind on Memphis

Although to comprehend
I think we’re heading souther once again

This time I’ll let you come along
Cause you know just what to do
This time I’ll let you come along
Cause I need somebody new
