You’re on my mind, living in my soul
A moment in time move it and let it go
The air we breathe smells like love
Your melody makes me sing the sweetest song
Your energy is heaven

And I just can’t believe that
You’ve been sent to me from above
You’re my angel love
And I can’t wait to feel your
Sun shine down on me from above
Angel love

Here and now in the rhythm that we’ve found
Deep in the sound music is all around
The air we breathe smells like love
Your melody makes me sing the sweetest song
Your energy is heaven

And I just can’t believe that
You’ve been sent to me from above
You’re my angel love
And I can’t wait to feel your
Sun shine down on me from above
Angel love

I’ve waited for you all of my life
(I’ve waited for you all of my life)

I just can’t believe that
You’ve been sent to me from above
You’re my angel love
And I can’t wait to feel your
Sun shine down on me from above
Angel love
