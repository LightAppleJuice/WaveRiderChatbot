She leaves me with Jelly legs
Where did all my good luck get to
We're curled up like sleeping kittens on the floor
Stowed aboard your big green boat

She took aim with a turned back
Blew holes in me with cold silence
Then a science project volcano erupts inside me
Filling me with flat champagne

Stretched out like a rubber band
From one planet to the next
You went hunting with your grandfather
That lonely night
I guess I'll meet you in the afterlife

She leaves me with jellylegs
Where did all my good luck get to
Like a lonely kitten, sinking, drowning in the harbor
I walked the plank, your big green boat

I guess I'll meet you in the afterlifeâ€¦
