I didn't mean to abuse and hurt you
I was a fool that much is so true
Swimming with all the yellow daffodils
My love so golden so bright

Now you are gone i see all of the light now
I was confused I didn't know what to do
Love pulled me in so many strange ways
And robbed us of our days

Of our days flying high
Dragonflies in the a blue sky
My heart beats, beats for you
Only you

Can you forgive me and can you hear me
Do you know i will always love you
Swimming with all the yellow daffodils
My love so golden so bright

You have shown me so much about life
I feel your presence each and every day
Love pulled me in so many strange ways
And robbed us of our days

Of our days flying high
Dragonflies in the a blue sky
My heart beats, beats for you
Only you
