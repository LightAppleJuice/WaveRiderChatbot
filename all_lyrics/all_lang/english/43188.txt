I’m outside in the cold
Thought stars will bring the light
I should have learned by now
They just come out at night

The things they always say
The tunnels lead to light
It’s something I don’t see
‘Cause it’s too dark tonight

Let go now, let go now
It’s all for you

And you give all you got
But it’s never enough
When you’ve got, nothing left
It all just gets too much
