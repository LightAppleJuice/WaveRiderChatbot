Vince's jabber)))

Ya ever seem to have one of those days
Where it just seems like everybody's gettin' on your case?
From your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend?
Well, ya know, I used to have 'em just about all the time
But I found a way to get out of 'em
Let me tell you about it!

Sittin' in the classroom thinkin' it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap -- just ain't my bag
When two bells ring you know it's my cue
Gonna meet the boys on floor number 2

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

Checkin' out the halls makin' sure the coast is clear
Lookin' in the stalls -- nah, there ain't nobody here
My buddies Sixx, Mick & Tom
To get caught would surely be the death of us all

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

Put me to work in the school bookstore
Check-out counter, and I got bored
Teacher was lookin' for me all around
Two hours later you know where I was found

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

One more time

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher I ain't foolin' around with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
