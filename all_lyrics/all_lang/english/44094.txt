Sit-in' by the TV, sittin' drinkin' my wine
My friends all say that I'm wasting time
I'm gonna wait right here just to get the right meat
I been waiting for hours, I can wait all week.

I'm not talkin' 'bout love
Not talkin' 'bout war
Get what I need from the girl next door!

Been watchin' cartoons on the TV screen
What I'm looking for is long and lean
A ticket to ride, I want my feet in the air
I'm gonna tell my baby that I just don't care.

I'm not talkin' 'bout love
Not talkin' 'bout war
Get what I need from the girl next door!

Yeah, get what I need! Oh yeah! Oh!

Been runnin' down the scene with my gasoline
I'm feeling nasty and mighty mean
Said outta my way cause I'm runnin' hot
I got to show my baby just what I got.

I'm not talkin' 'bout love
Not talkin' 'bout war
Take what I need from the girl next door!
I'm not talkin' 'bout love
Not talkin' 'bout war
Take what I need from the girl next door!
I'm not talkin' 'bout love
Not talkin' 'bout war
Get what I need from the girl next doooooooooooor!

Yeah I get what I need from that mojo, yeah!
