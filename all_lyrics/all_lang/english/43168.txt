Walls around your heart
I wanna get in
I wanna know you...
You're scared to lose it all
I know who you've been
But I'll take a chance on you...

You fight the light
You push it away
You're gone with the wind at the end of the day
But where are you going?

You play it safe
So there's nothing to win
I wanna come closer but you won't let me in
I wanna go where you're going...

Pull me in tonight
And stay forever
I wanna know the secrets of your heart
Let's begin tonight
It's now or never
Love won't happen til you try to cross the Great Divide...
