Looking around,
With my new conformation,
Broken you down,
What is love,
What is fear.

Make a new sound,
Open up my mouth to let it out,
Set it free.

Turning around,
Where was one to question to the rain,
Now can be one fine day,
One fine day is today,
One fine day (day),
One fine day.

Catching a wave,
May no change, may no feelings,
Pulling me in, this time nobody too.

Better be brave,
Cocked in the sunlight and the cave,
I must choose.

Comin' of age,
Even my mistakes have turned the page,
I won't loose one fine day,
One fine day is today,
One fine day (day),
One fine day.

Ohoooo!

I know life can be what simmers in your heart,
One fine day,
I know everyone exactly as they are, who you are?
One fine day,
One fine day is today,
One fine day,
One fine day.

Ohoooo!

One fine day,
One fine day is today,
One fine day (day),
One fine day.

Ohoooo!
