I cant believe you would treat me this way
I found you out
I hate the ground that you walk on
Don't fucking look away!

You think I'm not gonna cut you out?
Dont feel pity upon me cause I will end this now

I've got nothing to say to you anymore
I wanna bury your face into the floor
God your testing me... I want you fucking dead
You should have listened to me

I tried to forgive you for taking away my wings
I tried to forget you... Your tricks wont save you now
I tried to forgive you
I tried to forget you
Forget you!

You tried to bring me down
This time it wont be the same
You tried to bring me down
But you will never be found

You tried to bring me down
This time it wont be the same
(Your world is breaking and everythings changing)
You tried to bring me down
But you will never be found

And so we end this now
I walk this road alone
I left you buried deep where all your thoughts will drown
