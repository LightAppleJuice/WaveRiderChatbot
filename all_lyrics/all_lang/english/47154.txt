Take a look at yourself
You're going somewhere
Such a beautiful thing
And it feels right
Never too late
To believe in something
And open your eyes
See what the world is saying

You should see how good you are right now
You should see how good you look right now
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you

Take another deep breath
Look at your reflection
You're a beautiful thing
And it feels right

Give a little bit more
Try a little bit harder
Can do anything
Hear what the world is saying

You should see how good you are right now
You should see how good you look right now
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you

Take another deep breath
Look at your reflection
You're a beautiful thing
And it feels right

Give a little bit more
Try a little bit harder
Can do anything
Hear what the world is saying

You should see how good you are right now
You should see how good you look right now
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you
Let the night, let the night, let the night, let the night
Follow you
