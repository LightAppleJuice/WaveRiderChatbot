And you opened your eyes in a different way
Never looked to the future
And you play with your clothes in a distant way
To avert a disaster

And i'm just dying to find
These fingers of mine
Get lucky this time

Skies on fire
You look so good
Skies on fire
This rush of blood
My heart rate higher
And architects and artists
Build towers to admire
You control the floodgates
And i'm on fire
I'm on fire..

And the words that you said never went away
Happy endings and earthquakes
And the look in your eye it can make my day
When its gone gives me headaches

But i'm just dying to find
Some reason in rhyme
Get lucky this time

Skies on fire
You look so good
Skies on fire
This rush of blood
My heart beats higher
'cause architects and artists
Build towers to admire
You control the floodgates
And i'm on fire

'Cause those architects and artists
Build towers to admire
You control the floodgates
And i'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
You look so good
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
'cause you control the floodgates
And i'm on fire
