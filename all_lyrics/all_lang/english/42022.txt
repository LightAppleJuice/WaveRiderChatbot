I found my Religion 
In a pound of grass 
My life ain't that bitchin' 
It's Anesthetized 
Oh it don't look good 
And you don't know me 

While we ride together now 
Here to make a scene we don't wanna turn the music down 

Stepped into the kitchen 
What a surprise 
Overcooked the chicken 
And now its burned 
Oh it don't look good 
I'm going hungry 

While we ride together now 
Here to make a scene 
We don't wanna turn the music down
