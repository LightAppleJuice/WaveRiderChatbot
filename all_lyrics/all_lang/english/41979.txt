Hey, there’s something in the way
Oh, it’s just me and my brain
Look, there’s an elephant in the room
I know, I’ll make a piano and play a little tune
And I’ll write the perfect song for the perfect day
Might take a little time before my song gets played

Just get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way
Just get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way

There’s spit on my face
The hot breath of the human race
And I know, I know, I’m supposed to integrate
But hows about instead I inch away?

Just get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way
Just get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way

I'm not anti-social 
I'm just tired of the people
And I'm fine with rolling solo
So get out

Just get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way
Just get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way
