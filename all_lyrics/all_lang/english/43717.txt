Even if the ocean disappeared
Even if the clouds would shed no tears
I've had everything I need right here
As long as you're next to me!

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the Moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind,
I'll find a way to you
And even if the world forgot to turn
Even if the Sun refused to burn
And even if it takes me 'round the Earth,
I'll find a way to you

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the Moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind,
I'll find a way to you

Even if the seasons turn to black
Even if the ground will begins to crack
Nothing in this world will hold me back
Until you are next to me
Even if the ocean disappeared,
Even if the clouds would shed no tears
I's still had everything I need right here
As long as you're next to me!

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the Moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind,
I'll find a way to you
And even if the world forgot to turn
Even if the Sun refused to burn
And even if it takes me 'round the Earth,
I'll find a way to you

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the Moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind,
I'll find a way to you
