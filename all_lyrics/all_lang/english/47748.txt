Saw you walking down our street
Well, you looked, looked quite neat
Baggy jeans and long blond hair
With not a care in the world

What happened to the attitude
You used to have at school?
What happened to the attitude
Where you broke all the rules?

I saw you just the other week
Well, we did not speak
You turned your back and flicked your hair
As if you did not care

Well, I don't care where you come from
I don't give a damn
I don't care where you come from
It's all a sham

You're so special, oh, so special, oh, so special

She sings
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on, a groovy train
(On a groovy train)
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on, a groovy train

She sings
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on a groovy train
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on a groovy train
(Yeah, on a groovy train)

Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on, a groovy train
(Get on a groovy train)
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on, a groovy train
(Get on a groovy train)

Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Groovy train, groovy train

You're so special, oh, so special
(Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on a groovy train)
You're so special, oh so special
(Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on a groovy train)
You're so special, oh so special
