Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Time on my side, I got it all
I've heard that pride always comes before a fall
There's a rumor goin' around the town
That you don't want me around
I can't shake off my city blues
Everywhere I turn, I lose

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Time is no healer if you're not there
Holy fever sets words in the air
Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I walk the streets at night

To be hidden by the city light, city light

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Love is like oxygen
