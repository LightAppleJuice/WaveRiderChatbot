Dynamic explosions in my brain
Shattered me to drops of rain
Falling from a yellow sky
On orange faces to an opened eye
Stop me, hold me back as I jerk
Stop me, voices from all those at work

Lips don't want to criticize, you know
Eyes can never tell you lies
It's the words

Take that fire burning my brain
Let me love it higher

Why is it so cold out here, so cold
Let me in
The price of your entry is sin
Go away then return
Know which face you have to turn
Eyes are glaring, voice's flaring

Caught up deep inside in my brain
Take my love and turn it to pain
Take my heart and tear it apart
Gonna burn in hard desire
