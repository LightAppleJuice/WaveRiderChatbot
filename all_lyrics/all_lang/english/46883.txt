[Verse 1]
What's the use
Waiting for a hand to touch
Not waiting for too much
I didn't choose
To live it out this way
Think of you every day
Been calling all the way back
To the part of lies
We're calling all the way back
Just for that night

[Chorus]
Just for A night

[Verse 2]
All things
Those long gone can't fight this wrong
Remember how it used to be
Waiting
Been calling all the way back
To the part of lies
We're calling all the way back
Just for that night

Remember
