You're the only one to cure me 
You're the only one to cure me 

You're the only one to (cure me) 
Feel so good inside 
You're the only one to (cure me) 
Feel so good inside 

All night, all day 
Me and you 
To carry me away 
All night, all day 
Me and you 
To carry me away 

Got lost inside my head 
Wind's been burning my skin 
Tired of this empty space 
I'm feeding from your touch
