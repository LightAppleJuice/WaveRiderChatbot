I'm not man or machine
I'm just something in between
(Whoa-oa-whoa-oh-whoa)
I'm all love, a dynamo
So push the button and let me go
(Whoa-oa-whoa-oh-whoa)
You want me to come alive
Just flick the switch into overdrive
You and me can let it be
Ready-Aim-Fire

Touch that dial - Turn me on
Start me like a motor, make me run
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Turn that dial all the way
Shoot me like a rocket into space
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it C'mon

I got fun, you want some
I'm ever ready, Dr. Love
(Whoa-oa-whoa-oh-whoa)
I'm antenna, aerial
I'm tunin' in I'm outta control
(Whoa-oa-whoa-oh-whoa)
You got love, you got a deal
You wanna drive then take the wheel
You and me can let it be
Ready-Aim-Fire

Touch that dial - Turn me on
Start me like a motor, make me run
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Turn that dial all the way
Shoot me like a rocket into space
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it Alright
