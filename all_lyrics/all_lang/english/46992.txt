Every time I'm with you
I get this feeling I can't explain
I don't ever wanna stop
In case I can't get it back again

I can't, I can't
I can't seem to get enough, oh-oh
I can't, I can't
I can't seem to get enough, oh-oh

36,000 feet above the clouds and we keep on climbing
36,000 feet, 36,000 feet, 36,000 feet, 36,000 feet

It feels like I'm always lost
Lost inside your love gaze
And I don't wanna let it go
Cause it might never feel the same

And we keep on climbing, higher and higher
And we keep on climbing, higher and higher

36,000 feet, 36,000 feet, 36,000 feet, 36,000 feet
36,000 feet, 36,000 feet, 36,000 feet, 36,000 feet
