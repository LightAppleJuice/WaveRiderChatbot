Keeping on the outside
Glimmer in the moonlight
Only shadows stays where we are
Creeping on the edge of the dark

We feel warmth in the cold corners
Eyes in the back of our heads
We roll out when the day's over,
Chasing silhouettes!

When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
We'll be the last ones standing

We'll be the last ones,
We'll be the last ones standing

City made of thin glass
Smoldering in pitch black
Sand so thick you can't see the stars
Can't tell good & evil apart!

We feel warmth in the cold corners
Eyes in the back of our heads
We roll out when the day's over,
Chasing silhouettes!

When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
We'll be the last ones standing
We'll be the last ones,
We'll be the last ones standing
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
When it all goes up in flames
We'll be the last ones standing
We'll be the last ones,
We'll be the last ones standing
