You think it was the trap that hold you down
Now this is not our fate loves watched the ground
And there is something more we know it has to be found
I know the world won't wait the tide is turning around
And there's not enough time there's not enough time

And all wicked was will never hold you down
Oh this is not our fate, the tide is turning around
And no there's not enough time, there's not enough time

And the fallen and the wasted and the halflight
I'd still be here for you in the last dance of an old life
Now the cool winds is blowing
And we can't stay but it's alright
When the night is gone, I will still be here

There's not enough time

Fallen and the wasted and the halflight
Still be here for you

There's not enough time
Not enough time
There's not enough time
Not enough time

And the fallen and the wasted and the halflight
I'd still be here for you in the last dance of an old life
Now the cool winds is blowing
And we can't stay but it's alright
When the night is gone, I will still be here
