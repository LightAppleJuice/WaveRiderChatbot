You take my love
You want my soul
I would be crazy
To share your life
Why can´t you see what I am
Sharpen your senses
and turn the knife
Hold me and you´ll understand
I´ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You´re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You´re a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promised me delight
(You need love)
Why must I lie
Find alibis
When will you wake up
