While horsemen ride across the green
And snow white still remains unseen.
Pegasus, the winged horse,
Relays his messages by morse.
And like some pirate sailor
We crossed the spanish main
And brought our magic carpet
To a marble staircased plain.

While handel plays his melody
Doctors cause uncertainty
And though i know the lifeguard's brave
There is no one for him to save.
And like some pirate sailor
We crossed the spanish main
And brought our magic carpet
To a marble staircased plain.

Cock robin views his frozen feet
And wraps them in a winding sheet
And calls out for his favourite drink
The persian that's as warm as mink.
And like some pirate sailor
We crossed the spanish main
And brought our magic carpet
To a marble staircased plain.
