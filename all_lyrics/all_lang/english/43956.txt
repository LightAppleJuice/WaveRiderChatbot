One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Hey mister bartender come here
I want another drink and I want it now

My baby she gone, she been gone two night
I ain't seen my baby since night before last
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

And then I sit there
Gettin' high
Mellow
Knocked out
Feeling good
And by the time
I looked on the wall
At the old clock on the wall
By that time
It was ten thirty daddy
I looked down the bar
At the bartender
He said, "Now what do you want Johnny?"

One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

Well my baby she gone, she been gone two night
I ain't seen my baby since night before last
I wanna get drunk till I'm off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

And I sat there
Gettin' high
Stoned
Knocked out
And by the time
I looked on the wall
At the old clock again
And by that time
't was a quarter to two
Last call
For alcohol
I said "Hey mister bartender!"
"well what do you want?"

One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
