Well I'm so tired of cryin' but I'm out on the road again - I'm on the road again.
I ain't got no woman just to call my special friend.

And I'm going to leave the city, got to go away.
I'm going to leave the city, got to go away.
All this fussing and fighting, man I sure can't stay.

You know the first time I travelled out in the rain and snow - in the rain and snow.
I didn't have no fellow, not even no place to go.

And my dear mother left me when I was quite young - when I was quite young.
She said "Lord have mercy on my wicked son."

Take a hint from me mama please don't you cry no more - don't you cry no more.
Cause it's soon one morning down the road I'm gone.

But I ain't going down that long and lonesome road - all by myself.
I can't carry you baby, gonna carry somebody else.
