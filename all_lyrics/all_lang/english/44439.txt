See the tarmac alight beneath my wheels
From my heat shield, the pavement begins to yield
People wonder what can this creature be
I'm the speed freak of the motor agency

Here comes lightning, a flash of silver steel
With my hoof down, I'm Satan at the wheel
Cuttin' corners, can't stop to count the cost
Chromium killer, if you cross my path, you're lost!

million miles of motorway has just begun
I hope another million miles is yet to come
Burn the buildings and the houses in the way
Turn the meadows into brand new highway

Feeling dizzy, the power takes like wine
I'm alone and the universe is mine
Rugged hero of women's magazines
My virility lies in motor screams

I can't hear what you're saying all that well
Hundred horsepower engine roars like hell
Yes, I know where I'm going to today
When I get there, could be a new highway

People tell me I'm missing out on life
Settle down with a saloon car and a wife
I'm gonna tell them, without my silver best
crawling future I've never met

million miles of motorway has just begun
I hope another million miles is yet to come
Burn the buildings and the houses in the way
Turn the meadows into brand new highway

Here comes lightning, a flash of silver steel
With my hoof down, I'm Satan at the wheel
Cuttin' corners, can't stop to count the cost
Chromium killer, if you cross my path, you're lost!
