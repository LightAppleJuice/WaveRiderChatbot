Riding, and riding,
We search across the land.
The snow, and wind,
Has frozen hearts of man,

But we ride,
We ride.

Many days ago,
We left our home,
With swords we ride into the night.

Fighting side by side,
To destroy our foes
And leave them without life.

We stop, consider,
The land that we travel.
Our maps, at home,
Direction, unraveled,

But we ride,
We ride.

Many days ago,
We left our homes,
With swords we ride into the night.

Fighting side by side,
To destroy our foes
And leave them without life.

So much time has passed
Since we left our land,
That we"ve become concerned.

That we"ll never find the battle,
That we should have fought and won,
But we won"t, stop, searching.

Lost, but still, we ride,
Search, until, we die.

We ride,
We ride,

Hungry, and tired,
The frigid plain yields little.
We trudge, on further,
Eating brine, and snow thats brittle,

We ride,
We ride,

We come upon a witch,
Who takes us in
To let us share,
her nightly fire

She asks of us our story,
And we lie and s
1315
ay
We ride around for hire.

She asks us if we"d
Like to have a map
and points us in some direction.

But we are far too proud
To stop so we keep silent,
And ignore her suggestion.

Lost, but still, we ride,
Search, until, we die.

All, the fault, of pride.
The gods, weep in, the night.

Lost, but still, we ride,
Search, until, we die.

All, the fault, of pride.
The gods, weep in, the night

We ride,
We ride.
