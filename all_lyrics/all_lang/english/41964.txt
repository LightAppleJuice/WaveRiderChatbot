Just another morning
With shaky hands, pounding head
I guess I did it again
Try to leave, but I can't stand
Start to think that I'm better off dead
I'm sick of this condition
Your kiss is my addiction
I can tell you cast a spell that knows no moderation
It's dangerous, the things we do

Under the influence, I got no defense
It might be criminal, but still I just can't quit
Under the influence, I'll take the consequence
Well if it's poisonous, let it take my last breath

Under the influence

Temptation, creeping up on me
Gets under my skin, won't let me be
Haunt my days and haunt my sleep, viciously unrelenting
Oh, lay down again
Oh, give in again
and oh, feel good again
Begging for another beautiful sin
It's dangerous, the things we do

Under the influence, I got no defense
It might be criminal, but still I just can't quit
Under the influence, I'll take the consequence
Well if it's poisonous, let it take my last breath

Under the influence, the walls are closing in
It's inevitable, but I can't see him
leaving out the destruction of your love
Oh, oh

Under the influence, I got no defense
It might be criminal, but still I just can't quit
Under the influence, I'll take the consequence
Well if it's poisonous, let it take my last breath

Under the influence, I'll take the consequence
Well if it's poisonous, let it take my last breath

Under the influence
