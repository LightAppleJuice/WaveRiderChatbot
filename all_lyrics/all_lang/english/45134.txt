When you speak my name it don’t matter to me
Where you place your blame it don’t matter to me
Oh where could you be walking to it don’t matter to me
Where do you go to?

You waded out, you waded out. The sea calls back to you

Take my wicked heart it don’t matter to me
Turn my twisted words it don’t matter to me
Oh what are you here waiting for it don’t matter to me

Where do you go to you don’t matter to me
You waded out, you waded out. The sea calls back to you
