Box up your dreams and wait for a miracle
When the fallen mans free his mind is formidable
Tie up my heart from breaking away oh way oh

We made our minds run gold with new liberty
A shift in thought, a lift in energy
Protect our hearts from breaking away oh way oh

And I’m losing you in the meantime
They’re accusing me at the same time

And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are golden
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are one
We are colourblind all our colours entwined make who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are golden

The young lion waits to wake up inside of me
They didn’t fall or give in, in spite of me
Knock out the hate mistaken KO KO

And I’m losing you in the meantime
They’re accusing me at the same time

Oh we are, we are, we are, we are, we are golden
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are one
We’re colourblind all our colours entwined make who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are golden

We are the end of the rainbow
With colours from our heads to our toes
We are the youth of the heroes

We are, we are, we are, we are, we are golden
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are one
We’re colourblind all our colours entwined make who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are golden 
We’re colourblind, all our colours entwined make who we are
