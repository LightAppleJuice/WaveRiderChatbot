[Verse 1]
Can you feel the way they think about me
Through the years
Told me I should just be myself
I'm better than they thought
If it's true why am I so faithful
To the girl
Tryna walk [?] herself
Not to scare her off

[Chorus]
If you don't know that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way

[Verse 2]
Can you see the nigger in my face
And I stay
Give it in the place of our hands
It's just another thought
Just another thought

[Chorus]
And if you don't know that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way

[Bridge]
Could it be, or can it
Can you breathe with out air?
All you ever wanted to know
Life is just a dream
If you could see without him
Tired of never wanting to know

[Chorus]
If you don't know that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way
(Special, you're special)
You are special in your own way, way, way
