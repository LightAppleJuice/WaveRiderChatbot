When the wind, behind our eyes swell
Staring down all who generalize well
A chemical change of the spirit
Will be the exchange for our visit

Putting more makeup on the masks that we wear
Turning our nightlights on in the daytime to scare

If we say that (we want it)
We only want it with the lights out
If it's a game, well (we want it)
We only want it with the lights out

If we enter through the front door
With the keys we stole the night before
Are we afraid to be the masters
Of the tingles of disaster

Ladies and gentlemen its time to beware
If this is the moment now to ask do we dare

If we say that (we want it)
We only want it with the lights out
If it's a game, well (we want it)
We only want it with the lights out
If we survive this (we want it)
We only want it with the lights out
So dedicated (we want it)
We only want it with the lights out
