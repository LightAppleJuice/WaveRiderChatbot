You're walking up with your eyes on me
It's looking good but I just don't know
I need a girl who can keep her head all night long
You didn't come just to see the show
I guess you know what you want to see
The way you smile lets me know I can't go wrong

I wanna touch you, wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long

I saw you standing there by the stage
Your black stockings and your see-through dress
You mouth is open but I don't want to hear you say good night
You're so yound, but you're over rated
I don't care 'cause I like your style
Don't know about your brain but you look alright

You're under cover but but your hands are clean
You show no class but you... your own
I know I can't stand another night all alone
Hey girl, would you like some wine?
What's you name, are you by yurself?
Are you the one, what's your sign, can I take you home?
