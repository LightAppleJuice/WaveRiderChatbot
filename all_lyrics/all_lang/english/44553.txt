I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me

When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Every thing's all right, aha hah

I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

Lips as sweet as candy
Their taste stays on my mind
Girl, you keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine

I got it bad for you girl
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
If I can endure

All the good love
When we're all alone
Keep it up girl
Yeah, you turn me on

I'm, I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

All the good love
When we're all alone
Keep it up girl
Yeah, you turn me on

Ah aha, I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

I say, I'm hooked on a feeling
And I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
