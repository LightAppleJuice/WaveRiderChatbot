You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Someday you'll pay the price
I know
I've seen it before
It happens all the time
You're closing the door
You leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
Yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings
But someday you'll pay
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want Paradise
But someday you'll pay the price
