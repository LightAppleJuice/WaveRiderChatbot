Don’t you miss yourself 
And all you used to chain it always ends 
And you keep on running backwards 
Keep on chasing your own demons 
So don’t waste another hour 
And let me in… 

Disarm yourself 
Release the fear 
Disarm yourself 
And hold me near 

Give yourself to me Ooh… 

Don’t you miss yourself 
And all you used to chain it always ends 
Look to other people turning 
While you’re hiding in the shadow 
So don’t run away in silence 
Let me in…
