Time bending faces 
Time mending places 
Time into time 
One white hand 
Holding silence 
Collapses Ecstasyâ€™s of violence 
Time into time 
Time Let your fist open wide 
You'll find the hand of the pattern 
Behind which we all hide 
Change into time 
A bubble of blood 
Shot from laughter 
Circles death 
Before and after 
Time beside time 
Smiles you're in wisdom 
Joy or a liar's kingdom 
See leaves scattered in the bracken 
Lemons in the spider's web 
And travell down a nature fruit path 
Where the seventh scent captures you 
And you try to stay it's flavour 
And find at it's source the green leaf already matted 
All things have a pattern 
Why is it so cold out here, so cold Let me in 
The price of your entry is sin 
Go away then return 
Know which face you have to turn 
Eyes are glaring, voice's flaring 
Woaaah! You're gonna burn 
Burn Burn
