Feelin' like I'll never get away
On a staircase to the day
Watch the numbers fallin' from below
Lost sensations never known
Every time that I see your smile
Makes me feel I gotta cry
Come on home, won't you come on home
Take this hurt away from me

See my tears fallin' to the floor
See this agony that's me
You haunt my days, haunt my nights
Brief excursions of delight
Then I wake and know it's all the same
Nothin' left -- no, nothin'

Feelin' like I'll never get away
On a staircase to the day
