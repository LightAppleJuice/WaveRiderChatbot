Ask me what my name is
And look me in the eye
Ask me what my game is
But don't ask me to die
I don't enlist
Because I don't believe in war
Got to resist
Because nothing's worth dying for

I'm just a man
And I wanna stay alive
Long as I can
I'm in no hurry to die
Hear what I say
Nothin's gonna change my mind
All I can say
Is that I want to survive

Nothing you can say
Gonna make me change my way
Don't you know I'm a peace-lovin' man
Nothing you can do
Gonna change my point of view
Don't you know I'm a peace-lovin' man
Woh, I'm a peace-lovin' man

Ask me what the time is
Look me in the eye
Ask me where my mind is
But don't ask me to die
I won't enlist
Because I don't believe in war
Got to resist
Because nothing's worth dying for
