Well Im a gonna raise a fuss I am a gonna raise a holler
About working all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Well the time to go on baby trying to get a date
Boss says no date son you gotta work late
Sometimes I wonder what Im a gonna do
But there aint no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and popa told me
Son you gotta make some money
If you want to use the car then go right on next sunday
Well I didn't go to work told the boss I was sick
Now you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick
Sometimes I wonder what Im a gonna do
But there aint no cure for the summertime blues

Gonna take two weeks gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem to the united nations
Well I called my congress man and he said quote
I would like to help you son but your to young to vote
Sometimes I wonder what Im a gonna do
But there aint no cure for the summertime blues
