Well I just want love 
You know it's all about love 
And I just need you 
To bring me back to love 

Oh, it's just you'll feel more love in hand to soul 
In hand to soul, oh, within life 
Enough love inside of us to save this world, all within love, 
Enough love inside of us to save this world

And maybe we just 
We'll go chasing, what the falling lights bring 
See you and me babe, we'll touch everything 
Take a long ride, no destination 
And maybe oneday, we'll fall in love

You, oh, you, oh, you, 
Nothing but you 
Yes, oh, you, yes, oh, you in this time 
Nothing but you  
Oh, you, oh, you 
Nothing but you 
Yes, oh, you, 
Yes, oh, you in this time 
Nothing but you 

Well on that night, you took my hand 
You told me that we'd never be together again 
And here we are, at the top of our time 
See you and I we just kept our souls entwined 

I knew we'd be together, through any kind of troubles 
I said we'd be together, until the end 
Cos you and I 
You and I, we just got together in love 

Through time and space 
Knew, you and I would touch the sun in our place 
And all that lies ahead of us 
See, you and I, we just came together in love 
Oh, you and I, we just come together in love 
You know, you and I, we just came together in love 

Gonna let the sun come in 
Gonna let the sun come in 
Always a soul love, all about love
