Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo,
Happy birthday to you was created for you
Can't ever keep from falling apart
At the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart
To pieces
Oh, it'll take a little time,
might take a little crime
to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry
Who do you need, who do you love
