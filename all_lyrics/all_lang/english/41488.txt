Well she's got to be a 20,
on a scale of 10
Walking on an edge,
that's razor thin
One in a million,
from her head to her toes
A hole in her heart,
as the next man's money goes

She's a cruel little number,
wild little weed
Momma's little princess,
daddy's bad seed
Mind of a maniac,
she's breaking all the rules
Cruel little number,
why do you have to be so cruel

She ain't tight with the ladies
She don't kiss and tell
She want a black Mercedes 500 SEL
She knows the scent of a dollar
Don't want a check in the mail
She blew the price of love
Right off the end of the scale

She's a cruel little number,
wild little weed
Momma's little princess,
daddy's bad seed
Mind of a maniac,
she's breaking all the rules
Cruel little number,
why do you have to be so cruel

Her heart can't be broken,
'cause it's stainless steel
You can beg, you can bargain,
but she's never going to cut you a deal

She's a cruel little number,
wild little weed
Momma's little princess,
daddy's bad seed
Mind of a maniac,
she's breaking all the rules
Cruel little number,
why do you have to be so cruel
