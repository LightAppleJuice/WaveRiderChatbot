Take me on a ride inside your heart, tonight
Just you and me, take me to live inside the truth
Sugar i wanna taste the way you feel inside
All through the night forget about the time just close your eyes

Sugar always 
Though my heart, it breaks baby
Oh let me be the one to come alone tonight
Let me be such a deep suprise

As the world you know begins to cry tonight
Just let it be if you wanna let it grow
Sugar we can come alive inside your dreams tonight
Live to believe you are the only one for me
