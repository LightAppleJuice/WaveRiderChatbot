I'm goin' on vacation
Find some place where my phone don't work
And while my phone can't ring
I'm gonna do my thing

I'm gonna get my mojo working
I'm gonna bang my drum
I got a hunch just what I need
I'm gonna get me some

I'm gonna take you with me
Find some place to hide
If and when they find us
At least we can say we tried

Yeah I'm gonna get my motor movin'
I'm gonna dress in black
Walk down that red carpet
Show everybody I'm back
