New age rebellion - anarchy
Intoxicated with injustice of law
Sneaking lifes - mental decay
Practice subversive dirty deeds
No acts of grace - stand up and fight
You are their slave but never questioned why
Born on your knees - don't give a shit
You are remote controlled but who is to blame

Fuck the police

Blaze of anger - deaf and blind
The enemy that overshadows us all
Out of control - disrotted minds
The final judgement and the final day will come
Too much pressure - too much power
Until the point of no return
Interwar period - martial games
To find out what they try to ignore

Eternal lies - vision of change
When the dreams of freedom awake
Methods of greed - bleeding hearts
An easy target for the one with the gun
Empty promises - better left unsaid
Illusions shattered by mendacity and hate
Supremacy - hungry to kill
No more effectual fervent supplication
