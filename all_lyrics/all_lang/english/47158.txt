Girl, I say, if only life would lean our way
Well, you and me, we'd run away to be wherever our adventure waits
Time would be a distant memory, nobody could tell us to stay
I've been dreaming ever since I've seen you heaven when you came my way

I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love

Oh, it's seems awfully hard for us to find at all
All these years will wash away and we'll be clean but we'll have nothing more
I can't say there'll come another day where money and our time affords
On our hands, our wrinkles understand we never really wanted more

I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love

All the life about to go is in my mind
All the loudest voices in the world are never right

I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
