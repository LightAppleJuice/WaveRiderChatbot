This is rockin' radio, the wall of sound
This is your stereo so close to me
Citizen Kane rise again
Stay tuned to this frequency

This is rockin' radio, the wall of sound
The music that rocks, the music that shocks
The music that comes to you from everywhere
As listeners with music on the mind
I love that music, I love that sound
I love that record, I love that noise
You're tuned to radio WOS, the wall of sound

I'm in trouble, I'm in deep
I don't know why you can't sleep
I feel something in my brain
It's this sound that's keeping me sane
I love that music, I love that sound
I love this new channel I've found
I love that record, I love that noise
This frequencies my favourite toy

Radio wall of sound, coming up from my tower
Radio wall of sound, twenty four hours of power

My head's spinning around
An' if in stereo sound
It tells me just who I am
Who's that? Telegram Sam
I love that record, I love that noise
Now my girl rocks with the boys
I love that music, I love that sound
So just play the radio loud

Radio wall of sound, coming up from my tower
Radio wall of sound, WOS power
Radio wall of sound, coming up from my tower
Radio wall of sound, twenty four hours of power

This is rocking radio wall of sound
The music that rocks, the music that shocks
The music that comes to you from everywhere
'Cause this is the music of the mind
I love that record, I love that sound,
I love it, I love it, I love it
This is the big one
This is the wall of sound

I love that music, I love that sound

You're listening to radio loud
Wall to wall sound
The music comes to you from around your head
Look out!

I love that record, I love that noise

You think the music's here
It's not, it's inside your head
You are the wall of sound

Radio wall of sound, coming up from my tower
Radio wall of sound, twenty four hours of power
Radio wall of sound, coming up from my tower
Radio wall of sound, WOS power
Radio wall of sound
