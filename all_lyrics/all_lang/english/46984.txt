When ever dark is fallin'
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawin'
We can throw out all the blues and hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' ev'ey where
So give me the night
Give me the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine a glass of wine a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
You see the people of the world comin' out to dance

And if we stay together
We'll find the rhythm of the evening takin' us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancin' in the street 'til the morning' light
