Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive

Eight o clock in the morning
To hard to give, to hard to live
I can't stop dreaming
Do you know what I mean
You make up you ??? eyes
You stay hidden, I can't see your smile
I wanna stay, it's not your ???
I want to feel fine
You have to survive

Twenty minutes and I'm ready
It's not rainning today
I'm late and I must hurry
Walking to my (wife ?)
You have to survive
I don't wanna ???
It's not rainning today
Keep the light
I can't see

Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive
Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive

You know I'm not a ???
We are playing tonight
Every sens this morning
Your kisses on my skin
What your ??? tonight
When you talk to me
You know I need you
To make it real

Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive
Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive

You gonna die, die, die
I get, I get what you're saying to me
I gonna smile, smile, smile
For get, for get, for get it I wanna be
Come inside my world
Live the ??? outside
I've got the words
Let it blow your mind (mais alors pas sur du tout)

It's a lie, lie, lie
I get, I get what the story would be
You gonna try, try, try
Escape, escape, escape from misery
Stop the motion
I've got the solution
Wake up, ??? , escape and get free

Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive
Time is running out
Goes keeping we alive
I (get ?) what it means
You have to survive
