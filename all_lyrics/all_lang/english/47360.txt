I wanted to love you, I wanted to be with you
You wanted my heart to stop, stop feeling
And you with this attitude, ice cold, bulletproof
Couldn't shoot my love, love into you

If you're gonna do one thing, don't let go
If you're gonna cut my strings, cut them all
But don't leave me hangin' on

I don't know why you did me like this
I don't know why you ruined my bliss
But you keep me, keep me hangin' on
Near and far, we sit at sunkiss
Staring at your lips with your [?]
Here we are, here we are just hangin' on
Just hangin' on, just hangin' on

I wanted to stop you, I wanted to run with you
You wanted me to stop, stop trying
To explain how difficult, it was to let you go
Did someone put a bullet through my head?

If you're gonna do one thing, don't let go
If you're gonna cut my strings, cut them all
But don't leave me hangin' on

I don't know why you did me like this
I don't know why you ruined my bliss
But you keep me, keep me hangin' on
Near and far, we sit at sunkiss
Staring at your lips with your [?] 
Here we are, here we are just hangin' on
Just hangin' on, just hangin' on

If you're gonna do one thing, don't let go
If you're gonna cut my strings, cut them all
But don't leave me hangin' on

I don't know why you did me like this
I don't know why you ruined my bliss
But you keep me, keep me hangin' on
Near and far, we sit at sunkiss
Staring at your lips with your [?] 
Here we are, here we are just hangin' on
Just hangin' on, just hangin' on

Just hangin' on, just hangin' on
