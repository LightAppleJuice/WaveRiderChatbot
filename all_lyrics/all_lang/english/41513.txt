Well - you can have your gold and your diamonds too
All I want is a ring dang doo
Well I've been all over this great big world 
Looking for a ring dang doo
I've fallen in love with a thousand girls 
Looking for a ring dang doo
I've got a mojo and some voodoo too
But I ain't never found a ring dang doo

Well I was down ina New Orleans
Looking for a ring dang doo
I fell in love with a girl in blue jeans
Looking for a ring dang doo
But I can't stay though my love is true
I gotta keep looking for a ring dang doo

From Mexico to the Philippines 
Looking for a ring dang doo
Well I've drunk with peasants and I've dined with kings
Looking for a ring dang doo
But I ain't never found a single clue
I've gotta keep a-looking for a ring dang doo

Well people call me crazy every single day 
Looking for a ring dang doo
But I don't care what people may say no
Looking for a ring dang doo
I don't know what it looks like
Or what it can do
I gotta find that ring dang doo

Ring dang ring dang ring dang doo
Ring dang ring dang ring dang doo
You can have your gold and your diamonds too
All I want is a ring dang doo
