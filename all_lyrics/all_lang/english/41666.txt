I like to dream
Yes yes right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sight I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near, to the stars a-way from here

Well you don't know what we could find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride
Well you don't know what we could see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me, fantasy will set you free
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl, let the sound take you away

Last night I held Aladdin's lamp, so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me well someone took, took the lamp away
I looked around a lousy can was all I found
