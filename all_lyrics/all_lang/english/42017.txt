You get these urges to just drive when you're drunk 
I have these urges to just ride along 
Sometimes I think that I just don't remember names 
So then I'll say my ... to come clean 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

You left your roller coaster attitudes back home 
And found a little place just on your own 
Sometimes I think that there's no distance in between 
Our conversations baby when you dream 

I'll buy you a house and I'll buy you a car 
When I'll make it rich off selling a song 
When I'll make it rich babe 
I'll make you rich then you'll be my girl 
You'll be my girl, you'll be my girl 

You'll be my girl, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

Those simple moments they just seem to come for free 
Was just you and I and a quiet breeze 
You spent your adolescence with pictures on your wall 
You loved your idols baby, you ... them all 

I'll buy you a house and I'll buy you a car 
When I'll make it rich off selling a song 
When I'll make it rich babe 
I'll make you rich then you'll be my girl 
You'll be my girl, you'll be my girl 
You'll be my girl, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
