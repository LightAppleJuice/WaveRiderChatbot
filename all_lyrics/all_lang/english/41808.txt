I'm on my way
To steal the day
Turning to gold
Warm from the cold

The devil is near
I cannot hear
Your world is cold
Turning to gold

The angel's here
To cast out fear
Glitter of hope
Sever the rope

The devil is near
I cannot hear
Your world is cold
Turning to gold

Beautiful Scarlet, someone's really gonna hurt you
The birds are all singing, but noone's gonna sing for you
Time was when, smiling faces all around you
Beautiful Scarlet, get your feet on the ground

Beautiful Scarlet, there is a tear in your eye
The winter went slowly, but someone's gonna pass you by
I used to be happy, just following you around
Beautiful Scarlet, get your feet on the ground

I'm on my way
To steal the day
Turning to gold
Warm from the cold

The devil is near
I cannot hear
Your world is cold
Turning to cold
