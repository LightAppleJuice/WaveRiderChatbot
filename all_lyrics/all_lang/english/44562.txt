And when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock...
Of the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'cause there's not enough love to go round

[chorus:]
And sympathy
Is what we need my friend
And sympathy
Is what we need
And sympathy
Is what we need my friend
'cause there's not enough love to go round

Now half the world
Hits the other half
And half the world
Has all the food
And half the world
...
'cause there's not enough love to go round
