Drawn into the backdrop here
You could fade, you could fade away
Bright lights on a starless night
Burn a hole in the dying day

Looking at life through a loaded gun
Take your best shot, aim it at the sun
Looking at life through a loaded gun
You know you’ll find

You’ll find yourself, you’ll find yourself alone
You’ll find yourself, you’ll find yourself

Drawn into the darkness here
With your eyes on the prize at stake
Faint hearts on an endless path
Letting go of the ones we break

Looking at life through a loaded gun
Take your best shot, aim it at the sun
Looking at life through a loaded gun
You know you’ll find

You’ll find yourself, you’ll find yourself alone
You’ll find yourself, you’ll find yourself

Drawn into the backdrop here
You could fade, you could fade away
Bright lights on a starless night
Burn a hole in the dying day

Looking at life through a loaded gun
Take your best shot, aim it at the sun
Looking at life through a loaded gun
You know you’ll find

You’ll find yourself, you’ll find yourself alone
You’ll find yourself, you’ll find yourself
