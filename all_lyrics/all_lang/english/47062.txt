Forgiveness, forgiveness;
everything is all over...
Forgiveness; everything is all over...
Forgiveness...

Oh, life:
if there was ever any doubt in my mind, it's now.
And for the first time
I think maybe we weren't meant to be.
I didn't think the answer could be answered
by anyone o'er than me...
think about it, dwell upon it;
try to find some clarity.

Didn't I give you enough?
What was wrong with me?
Dig it up... try to find
all that you can't see.

I want to love you; dunno if I can.
I want to give you one more chance.
Forgiveness: it comes so slow...
all is so uncertain, everything is unknown.
I want to love you; dunno know if I can.
I want to give you one more chance.
Forgiveness: it comes so slow...
all is so uncertain, everything is unknown.

My 'Angry Mode': it comes and it goes...
though it is a mystery
why I act so out of control
as to let my emotions get the best of me.
I can't help it; can't deny it.
There is anger; won't try to hide it.
Got to burn it; set it on fire.
Ashes blowin' in the sky and I wonder why...
