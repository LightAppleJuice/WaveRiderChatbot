I thought that it would stay that way, before today.
Before today.

I dont care if youve been here before.
You dont understand.
Tonight I feel above the law, Im coming into land.
I want your love and I want it now.

But I dont want a phone that never rings.

I dont want excuses.
I dont want your smiles.
I dont want to feel like were apart a thousand of miles.
I dont want your attitude.
I dont want your things.
But I dont want a phone that never rings.
I want your love and I want it now.

Thats what I thought before today.
