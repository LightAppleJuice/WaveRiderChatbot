These walls are disappearing, and I don't seem to care, 
Gets larger, and larger, and there's colour everywhere, 

Bodies are lighter, than ever, floating off the ground, 
Noises from the windows, but I cant hear a sound 

And all of my limitations begin to fade away, 
In this place I have freedom, its here I wish to stay, 

Thoughts become distant feelings, going with the flow, 
I'll just sit still now, begin by letting go...

Begin by letting go...
