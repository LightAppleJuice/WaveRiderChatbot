Before it’s too late and I hesitate 
Remember I came, from a small town 
I guess I’d have to say, I’m still running away 
From the old mentality, from a mode of thinking. 

You opened my eyes, opened my mind 
Got a new point of view, now baby 
And it’s all about you. 

All the things I’ve always thought 
Have all come to naught 
Got a new perception, yeah 
Almost a new reflection. 

I used to be afraid to fly. 
I’m still a little scared of darkness. 

Just follow the sound, guess I got around 
On my own initiative, but there was something missing. 
An alternate state, alternative ways, uncovering new sensation, yeah 
Discover my true potential. 

Opening doors, breaking down walls 
‘Till there’s no glass ceiling on It’s the only feeling. 
Got out of there fast, I ran from the past 
Some pieces of me got left behind 
And something will always be there. 

I used to be afraid to fly. 
I’m still a little scared of darkness.
