In this world confusion lies 
Within' the hearts and minds 
The headline say no peace today 
With other games to play 

Wake me up in the morning 
Wipe the teardrops from my eyes 
Wake me up in the morning 
Let the sunlight lift my eyes 

White man says this land is mine 
Black brothers trust their power sign 
Students boss with Chris cross thoughts 
Our blood is sipped like wine 

Wake me up in the morning 
Wipe the teardrops from my eyes 
Wake me up in the morning 
Let the sunlight lift my eyes 

We walk upon a sea of tears 
The promised land we seek 
So lay me down to sleep my love 
And pray my soul to keep 

Wake me up in the morning 
Wipe the teardrops from my eyes 
Wake me up in the morning 
Let the sunlight lift my eyes
