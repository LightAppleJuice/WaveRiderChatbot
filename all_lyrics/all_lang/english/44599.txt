Blown away, blown away
Riding so high
Sailing the seas of success
But how long will it last, baby?
That’s just any body's guess

Let me give you fair warning
Tomorrow never knows
'Cause ever since I was down there, yeah
That’s just the way it goes

So many times I’ve seen it happen
Count your blessings while you may
Just when you think you got it all
It could all get blown away
It could all get blown away, yeah, yeah, yeah

She tells you she loves you
And you're feeling good today
She kisses you with passion
But you know passion fades away

Like a robber at midnight
Someone steals it from your home
Soon you’re asking the daylight
Why am I all alone? Oh yeah

So many times I’ve seen it happen
Count your blessings while you may
Just when you think you got it all
It could all get blown away
Yes, it could all get blown away, blown away

Well, let me give you fair warning
Tomorrow never knows
Ever since I was down there, yeah
That’s just the way it goes

'Cause you know so many times I’ve seen it happen
Count your blessings while you may
Just when you think you got it all
It could all get blown away
It could all get blown away, yeah

Blown away, blown away
