Hold on!

I like black and white (dreaming of black and white)
You like black and white
Run run away

See chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run run away

If you're in the swing (money ain't everything)
If you're in the swing
Run run away

If you gotta crush (don't beat about the bush)
When I gotta crush
Run run away

Oh now can't you wait (love don't come on a plate)
Oh now can't you wait
Run run away

See there chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run run away

Run run away
