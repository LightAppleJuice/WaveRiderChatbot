Stars shoot across the ever open midnight skies 
Fires lighting up the heaven 'til it hurts my eyes 
Starbright, starshine everything is beautiful 
Wonder where you go to when you’ve passed above this universe 

Ultraviolet cosmic death-defying rays of light 
Keeps turning, burning on its never-ending flight 
Starshine, starbright everything is beautiful 
Wonder where you go to when you’ve passed above this universe 

Starbright, starlight 

Stars shoot across the ever open midnight sky 
Divine sign, man awake, the end of earth is nigh 
Starbright, starshine everything is beautiful 
Wonder where you go to when you’ve passed above this universe 

Starbright, starlight
