Lucille, you won't do your sisters will
Lucille, you won't do your sisters will
You ran off and married
But I love you still

Lucille, please come back where you belong
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've been good to you baby
Please don't lead me along

I woke up this mornin', Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips was tight
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've been good to you baby, please don't lead me along

Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
I played love with you, baby
And gave you such a wonderful start
