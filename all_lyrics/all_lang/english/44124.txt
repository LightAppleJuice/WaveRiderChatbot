The old man was a good man, he raised his children right
He taught us how to work hard and showed us how to fight
Told me about the good Lord and when to use a gun
Made me very proud of where it is that I come from

When I die put my bones in the Dixie grave
Look down on me smiling I don't want no beating tune
All I leave behind me is a ragged old guitar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar

Nobody, old man turned me loose
Way cross town I learned about them sad ol' country blues
Taught me how to break my heart then try to make it right
Told me not to ever break but one alone at a time

When I die put my bones in the Dixie grave
Look down on me smiling I don't want no beating tune
All I leave behind me is a ragged old guitar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar

Hope you'll have me on your memory like a painted old tattoo
I might not make no history book but I'll burn a page or two
Yeah

When I die put my bones in the Dixie grave
Look down on me smiling I don't want no beating tune
All I leave behind me is a ragged old guitar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar
