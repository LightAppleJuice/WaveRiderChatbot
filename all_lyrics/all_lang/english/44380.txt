This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing
Without a woman or a girl, no

You see,
Man made the car
To take us over the road
And man made the train
To carry the heavy load
And man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Just like Noah made the ark

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little bitty baby girl
And a baby boy
Man makes them happy
'Cause man makes them toys
I'm a man makin' everything
Everything I can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other men

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman or a girl

He's lost
In the wilderness
Lost
In bitterness
He's lost

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
A man's, man's, man's man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman or a girl

This is a man's world, yeah

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Oh, a girl

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
Man, it's a man's world ...
