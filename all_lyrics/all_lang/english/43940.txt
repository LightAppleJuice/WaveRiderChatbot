One day my prayers are gonna be answered
Soo long I been hungry for something else
Where there's a will n there's a way... cause
The lord helps those who help themselves

Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin

Right now somebody's counting my money
So much they can't see the top of the stack
There's a will there's away
Moneys gonna find my hand one day and
When it does I ain't looking back

Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin
