We look for relaxation
So the only explanation
Create in funny hardware
And use it everywhere

Go! I Watch the yellow screen
Go! Now here we come?
Go! The fear is speared me
Go! And come to the bomb

We like this kind of action
It gives you satisfaction
I feel your chest is pumpin'
I see that monkey jumpin'

Go! I watch the yellow screen
Go! Now here we come?
Go! The fear is speared me
Go! And come to the bomb
