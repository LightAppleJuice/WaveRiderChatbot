Burn...

I am falling deeper,
And deeper into my mind
I do feel a fire,
Inside me so strong this time

Feels like I"m going to change just inside
(Feel a fire, Inside me so strong this time, burn)
Feels like I"m going to change just inside
(Falling deeper and deeper into my mind)

Burn!
There"s a fire deep inside of me 
Burn!
I am burning for returnity
Burn!
There"s a fire deep inside of me
Burn!
I am burning for returnity

I am falling deeper,
And deeper into my soul
Dare you, take me away from this place
I"m so cold

Feels like I"m going to change just inside
(Feel a fire, Inside me so strong this time, burn)
Feels like I"m going to change just inside
(Falling deeper and deeper into my mind)

Burn!
There"s a fire deep inside of me 
Burn!
I am burning for returnity 
Burn!
There"s a fire deep inside of me 
Burn!
I am burning for returnity

Burn!
I am, I do burn!
Burn! 
I am, I do burn!

Feels like I"m going to change just inside..

Burn!
There"s a fire deep inside of me 
Burn!
I am burning for returnity
Burn!
There"s a fire deep inside of me 
Burn!
I am burning for returnity

Feels like I"m going to change just inside..
There"s a fire deep inside of me!
Feels like I"m going to change just inside..
I am burning for returnity!
