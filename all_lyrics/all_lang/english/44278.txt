The sun is fading from your city Life Child
From where I stand it ain't so pretty Life Child
I see your sun is going down
I see your wreckage on the ground oooh Life Child

Your seas are full of poisoned water Life Child
We took the place that was your daughter Life Child
And as our dirt is spread around
We build our houses on the ground oooh Life Child

Came down to Earth to comfort me mmmm... Life Child
So that my spirit could be free mmmm... Life Child
We left you hanging on a hill
Why won't we ever do your will

The sun is fading from your city Life Child
From where I stand it ain't so pretty Life Child
I see your sun is going down
I see your wreckage on the ground oooh Life Child
