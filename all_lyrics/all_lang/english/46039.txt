I spend my money on the regular miracles
Just like you, like me, like everybody else.
Up on the sun, lookin' sad and beautiful
Just like you, like me, like everybody else.

(When it gets loud, I turn it up)
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
(When it's too hot, I light it up)
Ooh, light it up, yeah, smoke em if you got 'em

Here come the jets, hide my money in your tube socks
Run like me, like hell, like everybody else
Hair metal on a Japanese boom box
Kicks like you, like me, like everybody else

(When it gets loud, I turn it up)
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
(When it's too hot, I light it up)
Light it up, yeah, smoke em if you got 'em
(When it's too soft, I shake it up)
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
(Youâ€™re so sweet, but I like it rough)
Ooh, light it up, yeah, smoke em if you got 'em

Makin' a movie on the couch with a flip phone
Just like you, like I, like fingers in your mouth.
Up on the sun, playing drums with a bleached bone
Just like you, like me, like everybody else.

(When it gets loud, I turn it up)
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
(When it's too hot, I light it up)
Light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
(When it's too soft, I shake it up)
Like I look at a bad girl up in Harlem
(You're so sweet, but I like it rough)
Ooh, light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
