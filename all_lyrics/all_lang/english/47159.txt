I don't have a cent
Will I pay my rent?
And even my car doesn't work
Me and my man?
He's the one to die for...
We have split up

Can't you see life's easy
If you consider things
From another point of view
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah
In another way
From another point of view
Ye ye ye eheh
Oh oh yeah
In another way from
Another point of view

I see life and light
All the colours of the world
So beautiful
Won't you come with me?

I see birds and trees
All the flowers of the world so beautiful
Won't you come with me?

Can't you see life's easy
If you consider things
From another point of view
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah
In another way
From another point of view
Ye ye ye eheh
Oh oh yeah
In another way from
Another point of view
