My eyes, that cannot see
other guys that are cuter
and my ears that cannot hear
my friends say
i should walk away

without my heart
it won't do babe
it won't do without you
without my heart
it won't do babe, it just won't do without you

my knees that all go weak
that all go kiddiup
when you don't call me
and my head
it thousand spend
so don't tell me
without your sweet happen

without my heart
it won't do babe
it won't do without you
without my heart
it won't do babe, it just won't do without you

my mind is buggin out
when i think your in
seem it wrong
like i expect
and my toes watch them curl
so don't call me babe cause i'm your little girl

without my heart
it won't do babe
it won't do without you
without my heart
it won't do babe, it just won't do without you

my mind is buggin out
when i think your in
seem it wrong
like i expect
and my toes watch them curl
so don't call me babe cause i'm your little girl

without my heart
it won't do babe
it won't do without you
without my heart
it won't do babe, it just won't do without you
