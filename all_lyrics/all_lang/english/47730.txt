I ain't gonna be the first to cry
Even though you had the last laugh on me
I ain't gonna be the first to cry
Even though you had the last laugh on me
You're just a link in my chain
Someone else will end this misery

I ain't gonna be the lonely one
Someone will chase the clouds away
I ain't gonna be the lonely one
Someone will end this rainy day
It's just a matter of time
And time is all I got since you went away

I ain't gonna be the first to cry
Even though you had the last laugh on me
I ain't gonna be the first to cry
Even though you had the last laugh on me
You're just a link in my chain
Someone else will end this misery

I ain't gonna let the teardrops fall
They could never wash away this pain
I ain't gonna let the teardrops fall
Even though you turned my love into a game
There's just one thing, that you should know
You'll be sorry some day
