There's a face in the mirror, and you close your eyes
Much easier to turn away, than to take a look inside
So you're thinking it's over, walking away
Let your little world crash and burn, ooh what a price to pay
Didn't anybody tell you it's not who's right or wrong
Hold the line, is this what's going on?

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there yes I will

There's a crack in the mirror, there's a hole in the sun
Full moon in the midnight sky, and you feel like you wanna run
So you blow out the candle and you turn out the light
Then you stumble into darkness - who'd believe that love is blind?
Didn't anybody tell you it's never too late to try?
Hold the line, before you say goodbye

Now I'm not talking about what's good for me
And I'm not saying how you ought to be
But if there is a message shining on through to you
Take a little peace of mind and let that love-light shine

Didn't anybody tell you it's not too late to try?
Hold the line, before you say goodbye

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there yes I will

Enjoy!
