White jeans, daydream
You and me, our sheets
Wearing Nike
Kissing, no sleep

Damn, tell me where we went wrong
Been in love for so long, now it's over
How, how did we get this far?
And still not know who we are
Is this really over?

Everything was better when
You would call and I'd be like "yea, babe"
We should talk about love again
Every night I'm wide awake
I almost call you, then I'm like "no way"
Oh, no way

Hate how it feels
I know you're down the street
With someone else but me
Time, yeah, I need time
Can't forget about how you let me down
