Grab your coat the sun sets right at 6:35 tonight
Gets kinda cold but I wanna hold ya please tell me that’s alright

It’s been a while since we first met at the party up on the hill
And I’m thinking we should make out if you want me still

You are my number one baby
I like you lots
I think everybody knows baby
I like you lots

Windows down we can smell the ocean
It’s hard to see thru our hair
When we’re together we look like the coolest
Babe you know they all stare
