I was walking in the sun
And the day had just began
I saw her walk around the beach
Her perfect body within reach
And when I heard what she had to say
She took my hand and we walked away

Tora, Tora, Tora
I will stay with you tonight
All night
Tora, Tora, Tora
You will stay with me tonight
All night
Tora, Tora, Tora

We stayed together for a night
She disappeared out of sight
And as I walked around the sand
A different lady took my hand
And when I heard what she had to tell
My heart began to melt

Tora, Tora, Tora
I will stay with you tonight
All night
Tora, Tora, Tora
You will stay with me tonight
All night
Tora, Tora, Tora
