Rain, rain, rain for forty days 
To wash away the faithless song 
They say when all is said and done 
The rains will come, the rains will come 

Tiger tiger burning bright 
A reckoning will come tonight 
We’re born with masks and bread to lie 
Don’t have to try the heavens sigh 

I don't mind I know a storm is coming 
Things won't ever be the same again 
You can't run this time It has to be now or never 
Sooner or later it has to end 

I saw your mark, it's on the wall 
So nothing else will hurt at all 
When they all go the other way 
This world is ours and we will stay 

The cloud froze up a dying sky, 
The rivers rise, the flames are high 
Now they can sail with all the thieves 
And we can watch the last ship leave
