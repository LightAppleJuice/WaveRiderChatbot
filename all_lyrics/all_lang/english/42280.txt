See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom has come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come

Kingdom come

Fell the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a tire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come

Kingdom come

Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

Kingdom come

Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightfull are waiting
But all are not rightfull
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Kingdom come
