Stand back and illuminate
Your presence begins to shape
History is bound to change
Stand back and illuminate

In this wreck I'll start to form
A new reason to believe again
It's hard to see the misery and doubt you breathe
I never thought I would see the end of your existence

Another dream that was broken from the distance
You build resistance, now I'm indifferent
Now I believe in nothing from you

A fate to face the world in secret
You never thought you could love again
After a while the dream was dead
A way to connect is all you needed

I'm ready to know, ready to see
I keep on searching what connects with me
The sensation of dissociation
Give me something to bring me peace
We are all searching for integrity

Another face, a human counterpart
Behind a mask to deceive us
You're holding on and you know it's all a lie
Time to leave it all behind
