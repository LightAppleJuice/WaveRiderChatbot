oh my heart 
theres movement across the tracks 
i hope i can play it back, all night 
look at me look at you 
there givin us a 2 minute warning 

oh my heart 
changing the way i kill 
changing the way i feel step forward 
everybody, around the world 
uderstand what makes a child a man 

oh my heart 
taen me back to blue 
fallin into my own senses 
another night another day 
its better this way, let the music play
