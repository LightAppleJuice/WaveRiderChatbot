You
You made my heart move
Don't ask me how it felt they won't believe me
But now
The shimmer's gone somehow
Luster fades and gives way to truth
La-la-la lifted

Love can't stay, on a higher ground
The fall from grace, may not make a sound
Just pull me close
Never let me down
I want love that's lifted

Lifted 

The truth is there in loss that I have retraced
But I'm not scared to part ways anymore
What's the use?
Searching for love when you're afraid
Doing it all to make sure your heart stays

Lifted 

Love can't stay, on a higher ground
The fall from grace, may not make a sound
Just pull me close never let me down
I want love that's lifted
La-la-la lifted
