Mind your step
No tears left
You just don't know what I'm going through
Mind your step
Last I checked
You just don't know what I'm going through

Caught in between your world and mine
I really don't belong much of anywhere
Passenger of time on an endless ride
Subjected to a dream going nowhere

So often on a plane train or in a car
But always on the way back to where you are
Do you still care
What if we broke down within our shallow pool
Should I fool myself again and blindly follow you
Would it be fair

Caught in between - am I wasting time
Finding that it's hard to right on wet paper
But try, I still try, I'm the pantomime
Playing out the part of your enabler

So often on a plane train or in a car
But always on the way back to where you are
Do you still care
What if we broke down within our shallow pool
Should I fool myself again and blindly follow you
Would it be fair
