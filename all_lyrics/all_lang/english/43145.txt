Damn those helpless eyes, 
I was mislead by devil in disguise. 
Those damn angel eyes, 
I never thought you could cloud in my sky. 

But sun`s been down for fourteen days, 
Another day dream shattered million ways. 
And everything i did, 
And everything i did,
Frozen

The sun`s been down for fourteen days, 
Another day dream shattered million ways. 
And everything I did, 
And everything I did, 
Everything I did. 
Everything I did, 
Everything I did, frozen. 
I feel frozen, 
Frozen
