Kneel down ye sinners, to
Streetwise religion
Greeds been crowned the new king
Hollywood dream teens
Yesterday's trash queens
Save the blessings for the final ring - amen

Wild side

I carry my crucifix
Under my deathlist
Forward my mail to me in hell
Liars and the martyrs
Lost faith in the father
Long lost in the wishing well

Wild side

Fallen angels
So fast to kill
Thy kingdom come on the wild side
Our father
Who ain't in heaven
Be thy name on the wild side
Holy mary
Mother may i
Pray for us on the wild side
Wild side, wild side

Name dropping no-names
Glamorize cocaine
Puppets with strings of gold
East l.a. at midnight
Papa won't be home tonight
Found dead with his best froend's wife

Wild side

Fatal strikes
We lie on the wild side
No escape
Murder rape
Doing time on the wild side
A baby cries
A cop dies
A day's pay on the wild side
Wild side wild side
Tragic life on the wild side
Wild side wild side
Kickin' ass on the wild side
