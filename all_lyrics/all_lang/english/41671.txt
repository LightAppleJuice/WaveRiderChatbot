Sail, sail away,
There you go.
Why not let me come along,
I won't tell no one.

Now our bodies have entwined,
Touch me with your mind.
Your dreams are a mystery,
Please share them with me.

Curiosity is killing me,
I just got to know.
Curiosity is killing me,
I just got to know -
Where, tell me where,
Where are you sailing...
