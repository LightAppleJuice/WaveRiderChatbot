[Verse 1: Sian Evans]
Your love kills me
Your love fills me
See I lay down easy
What is it you've done to me?
[Chorus: Sian Evans]
Get everything you want
Get everything you do
The way you make me feel
Whatever it is you do to me, I wanna give it back to you, yeah
Giving it right back

[Verse 2: Sian Evans]
Giving it right, keep on doing
However you find me, oh I love [?]
You have me spellbound by the love beginning
Whatever you give me feels good in every way

[Bridge: Sian Evans]
Giving it right back
And now I can't believe
Giving it right back
Changes in my life, you made it easy
Giving it right back
You take the weight off me
Giving it right back
I worry I'm living too late
