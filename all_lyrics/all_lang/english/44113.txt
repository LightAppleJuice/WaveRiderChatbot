Take me to another place, a place that I can go
Where nobody looks the same and everybody's slow
Nothing seems to matter, yet somebody seems to care
Even though it's clearer now, there's something in the air
Oh, oh, what can I say?
Oh, oh, what can I say?

Taken lots of sweety things and looked towards the sky
Laughed until the morning came, just me, my friend and I
Teacher seems to pass us by and only is it then
We can stop and listen and I know we'll be there when
Oh, oh, what can I say?
Oh, oh, what can I say?

Funny money in paradise
Under cover is very nice
Maybe baby it seems alright
Jeffrey Lynne and George H tonight
Double vision and out of sight
Pennsylvania Blues tonight
Pennsylvania Blues alright

Thinking â€˜bout a miracle a free and easy way
Seven lonely travellers all bring it into play
Nothing seems to matter and nobody seems to care
Even though it's clearer now, there's something in the air
Oh, oh, what can I say?
Oh, oh, what can I say?

Funny money in paradise
Under cover is very nice
Maybe baby it seems alright
Jeffrey Lynne and George H tonight
Double vision and out of sight
Pennsylvania Blues tonight
Pennsylvania Blues alright

It doesn't mean a thing
Not anything at all
It's something good to sing
Pennsylvania Blues tonight
Pennsylvania Blues alright
