Gonna catch a flight to Nevada
Leave her friends at home in L.A.
Seven come eleven or blackjack
Gambling night and day yea

Cause she's a roller now, a high roller baby
She's a roller yea, a high roller baby

She likes to play for double or nothin'
She's tellin' all the boys she's hot
And everybody knows she's ready
To give it everything that she got

Cause she's a roller now, a high roller baby
She's a roller yea, a high roller baby

People try to tell her she's crazy
She doesn't hear a word they say
Tellin' all the boys to get ready
Cause she's givin' it all away

Cause she's a roller now, a high roller baby
She's a roller yea, a high roller baby

Cause she's a roller now, a high roller baby
She's a roller yea, a high roller baby

Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye...
