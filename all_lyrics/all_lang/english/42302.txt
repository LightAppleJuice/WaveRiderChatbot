I know I'm not as hot as the flame that burned here before me
I've been flipping through all your moments and tearing out memories

How long how long can you carry this note
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole
Until we come out on the other side

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Trying to wash all of my sins clean
I've gotten too filthy
The drain is full but still circles beneath me
Like a fool to sanity

How long how long can you carry this note
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole
Until we come out on the other side

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Will you come out alone
Will you come out at all
Will you come out alone

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone
