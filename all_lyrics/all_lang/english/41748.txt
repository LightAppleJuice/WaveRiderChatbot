Yoh pretty ladies around the world
Got a wierd thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too
We're about to go down
And you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide past the people as they stop to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mamma
Come on baby tell me what's the word

Word up everybody say
When you hear the call you've gotta get it underway
Word up it's the code word
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard

Now you sucker DJ's that think you're fly
There's gotta be a reason and you know the reason why
Why you put on your airs and you act real cool
Got to realise that you're acting like fools
Now there's music we can use it
You're free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me and mamma
Come on baby tell me what's the word
