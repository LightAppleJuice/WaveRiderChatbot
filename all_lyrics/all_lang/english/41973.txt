I... can't... get...
Away with murder.
I... am... bound...
To take it further.

I took the pills.
(I) I've been consumed.
(I) I drank the water.
(I) I had to choose.
I'm still here with a fire burning, burning inside.
If you want to burn, light it up, light it up, let it rise (let it right?).

When you're high, who ya flyin for?
When you ride, who ya ridin for?
When you toast, who ya drinkin for?
When you play, gotta deal with the devil.

(High) Gotta deal with the devil.

I... have... found...
Comfort in sorrow.
Now... I'm... bound...
Empty and hollow.
