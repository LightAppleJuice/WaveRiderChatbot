Shadows dancing on the ceiling
I'm hearing my heart that's beating
This heavy rhythm that's driving me insane
Message tells me something's wrong

Tonight, I can see the signs
Tonight's the night when the angels cry
Telling me this time it's forever

Running far away from me
I'm staring into the darkness
So tell me, who will you run to now?
Fire in your eyes are gone
You're pushing me to the distance
So tell me, who will you run to now?

Who's the one who stole your fire?
Who will you run to now?
Who's the one who stole the light?

Too late to turn back the hands of time
It's too late for me to wonder why
I should've known better
Than to let you slip away
I should've seen it coming
The writing's on the wall

Tonight, I can see the signs
Tonight's the night when the angels cry
Telling me this time it's forever
