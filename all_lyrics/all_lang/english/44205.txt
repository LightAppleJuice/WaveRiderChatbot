Lucretia Mac Evil, little girl, what`s your game?
Hard luck and trouble, bound to be your claim to fame.
Tail shakin`, home breakin`, truckin` through town.
Each and every country mother`s son hangin` round.
Drive a young man insane. Evil, that`s your name.

Lucretia McEvil, that`s the thing you`re doin fine.
Back seat Delilah, that`s your sixth big jug of wine, woman.
I hear your mother was the talk of the sticks.
Nothin` that your daddy wouldn`t do for kicks.
Never done a thing worthwhile, evil woman child.

Devil got you, Lucy, under lock and key.
Ain`t about to set you free.
Signed, sealed and witnessed on the day you were born.
No use trying to fake him out, no use trying to make him out.
Soon he`ll be taking out his due.
What you gone to do?

Ooh, Lucy McEvil, honey, where you been all night?
Your hair`s all messed up babe
And the clothes you`re wearin just don`t fit you right.
Big Daddy Joe`s paying your monthly rent.
Tells his wife he can`t imagine where the money`s went.
Dressing you up in style, evil woman child.

Oh Lucy, you just so damn bad.
