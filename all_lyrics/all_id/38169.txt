Conkers shining on the ground
The air is cooler
And I feel like I just started uni
Walking backwards to my van
You're at your window
And I'm tripping every time I think of

Lying in your attic
I can feel the static
The storm has broken
Heavens open
Send my body out to work
But leave my senses
In orbit over south east London
Wind the window down and
Pinch me on the shoulder
Whilst I'll be driving off to dream of

Lying in your attic
I can feel the static
The storm has broken
Heavens open

So electrifying, oh, I'm nearly flying
Lost my heart between the sheets of lightning

I've been singing you this song
Inside a bubble
Been zorbing through the streets of Cowley
We were always meant to be
Zorbing together
And I think it's high time we started

Lying in your attic I can feel the static
The storm is breaking, window's shaking
So electrifying, oh, I'm nearly flying
Lost my heart between the sheets of lightning
Lying in your attic I can feel the static
The storm has broken, heavens open
So electrifying, oh, I'm nearly flying
Lost my heart between the sheets of lightning
