North by north - lest we have to settle down
We can sail without the wind in this town
Things that London never saw
Northern winters start to thaw

To islands on the sea,
Lands I’ve never seen
Things will get calmer - follow me

You said a long long time ago
You were happy being someone
Let's go far far far from home
I'll be glad to be with someone

Land pneumonia, your engines in repair
Plant begonias and orchids in your hair
Continents all made of clay
Dreamers leaving every day

To islands on the sea
Lands I’ve never seen
Things will get calmer - follow me

You said a long long time ago
You were happy being someone
Let's go far far far from home
I'll be glad to be with someone

Someone told me you had oceans in your eyes
Cold as shadows over European skies
Coasting out the shallow day
Leaving London in decay

To islands on the sea
Lands I’ve never seen
Things will get calmer - follow me
