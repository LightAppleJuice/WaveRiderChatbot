You are my reflection 
So all that i have to say must penetrate 

You are my reflection 
There's no other way to communicate 
You are all i need to survive 
You help to sustain my life 
I don't know what i would do without you 
cause if i dont breathe, you dont exist 
if i dont call you by your name, 
i've mis represented 
my soul 

You are my reflection 
my smile in the morning 
my healthy morning meal 
my prayer in the afternoon 
i call on you 
i wake you up in me 
deep 
deep in the sense of my being 
you are indeed a reflection of me 
you are my good night's rest 
my full day of accomplishments 
you are a constant reminder of why i'm here 
you, like me, bear seeds of relief to the world 
we raise good crop for the hungry souls to eat from
we, as a team, work gracefully 
telling the land 

you are my reflection 
so here i stand with you in mind 
and anytime someone smiles at me 
or gives me warmth 
i know that you are here 
you are my sears portrait with no sitting fee 
no time to rest when the world is at its knees 
no time to make appointments 
no time to take notice 
no waiting for your name to be called 
i move to the rhythm of your heartbeat 

love, you are my reflection 
with you i have no fear 
with you there is nothing i cant bear 
you are my weapon against enemies 
sometimes people think im crazy 
cause with you i see no boundaries 
a "no limit" soldier 
a woman who's bear fruit and named him after 

love with you is real 
i have no doubt 
cause everytime i speak a hint of fresh air flows out.
