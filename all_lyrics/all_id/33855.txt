Every time I'm in your company 
I get a funny feeling that'll come to me 
Like a child that just witnessed a falling star 

And while I don't know what this means to me 
I'm confident to say it seems to be 
That the world is yours and that you should go far... 

All that you are... You can be all that you are...

It's part of who you are fundamentally 
How did I get this message that was sent to me 
I've got to admit this situation's quite bizarre 

But I've got something that can comfort me 
Even though you might not be the one for me 
That the world is yours and that you should go far... 

All that you are... You can be all that you are...
