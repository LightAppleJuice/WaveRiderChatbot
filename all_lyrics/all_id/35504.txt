In my search for freedom
And peace of mind
I’ve left the memories behind
Wanna start a new life
But it seems to be rather absurd
When I know the truth
Is that I always think of you
Chorus:
Someday someway
Together we will be baby
I'll take and you'll take your time
We’ll wait for our fate
Cos’ nobody owns us baby
We can shake we can shake the rock
Try to throw the picture
Out of my mind
Try to leave the memories behind
Here by the ocean
