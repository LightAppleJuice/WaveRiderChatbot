Lyin' beside me, your body's on fire.
Twisting the shadows that feed our desire.
Caught on a knife edge that fear can inspire.
Lost in a landscape.
Only the lonely survive just to stay alive
on retribution drive.

Storm clouds panic and rage outside.
And if you ignore them, they'll find where you hide.
None of our problems will lie on their side.
Lost in a landscape.
Only the lonely survive just to stay alive.

No, it's no use to pretend.
Always hoping the future
will somehow come right in the end.
We can't hide up in this room.
Just keep staring along the horizon
that covers the moon.
And wake up from the land of your night dreams.
Don't let them ruin your life with their schemes.
They just don't give a damn,
poison all that they can,
just for the glory of man.

Watching you sleepin' I just can't explain
moments of madness and moments of pain.
But none of our sadness will save the insane.
Lost in a landscape.
Only the lonely survive just to stay alive.

Out of the ashes the phoenix flies.
Screaming with anger in lead coloured skies.
Using its talons, will tear out their eyes.
Lost in a landscape.
Only the lonely survive just to stay alive
on retribution drive.
