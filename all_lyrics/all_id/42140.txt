I don't wanna know your name
Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
Ok, you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before

Fox on the run
You screamed and everybody comes
A-running take a run and hide
Yourself away
Fox is on the run
Foxy fox on the run
And hide away

You, you talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second hand (second hand)
I've heard it all before
I don't wanna know your name
Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before

Fox on the run
You screamed and everybody comes
A-running take a run and hide
Yourself away
Fox is on the run
Foxy fox on the run
And hide away
