Friday night and I need a fight
My motorcycle and a switchblade knife
Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are

Girls girls girls
Long legs and burgundy lips
Girls
Dancin' down on sunset strip
Girls
Red lips, fingertips

Trick or treat - sweet to eat
On halloween and new year's eve
Yankee girls ya just can't beat
But they're the best when they're off their feet

Girls girls girls
At the dollhouse in ft. lauderdale
Girls girls girls
Rocking atlanta at tattletails
Girls girls girls
Raising hell at the 7th veil

Have you read the news
In the soho tribune
Ya know she did me
Well then she broke mt heart

I'm such a good good boy
I just need a new toy
I tell ya what, girl
Dance for me, I'll keep you overemployed
Just tell me a story
You know the one I mean

Crazy horse, paris, france
Forget the names, remember romance
I got the photos, a mnage trois
Musta broke those frenchies laws with those

Girls girls girls
Body shop, marble arch
Girls girls girls
Tropicana's where I lost my heart

Girls girls girls
