You think you’ve paid some dues but not quite like me
I made it back from being cast out at sea

Well it’s not fair after all this time
And all I been through throughout my life
You’ve got gold records on the wall
And you gave me the blackball

You tried to tie me up and leave me for dead
But just like Houdini I escaped it instead

Well it’s not fair after all this time
All I been through throughout my life
Don’t need a hand or curtain call
Just give me the blackball

When the motor stops, I tell myself to keep going
When the road is blocked, I push on and just keep rolling
