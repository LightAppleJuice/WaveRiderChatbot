Born from His hands,
a wonderful man
made him a name to remember.
Two-thousand years
of blood, toil, and tears
all have the fun to remember.

Close your eyes if you want to wind
with you around your head let it go let it feel you.
Take a trip, get your mind
and let your mind trip to the things that we do.

Now that will seem
to work on a dream
that one of us guarded together.
And before long,
that could be a song
which you would make last forever.

Close your eyes if you want to wind
with you around your head let it go let it feel you.
Take a trip, get your mind
and let your mind trip to the things that we do.

Heaven and hell
are both doing well
showing the distance between them.
One of two more
to make you feel sure
now you have got to believe them.

Close your eyes if you want to wind
with you around your head let it go let it feel you.
Take a trip, get your mind
and let your mind trip to the things that we do.
