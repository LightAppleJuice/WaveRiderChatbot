When I need it so bad, why do you not come to defend
Is there any way to tell me that you're gonna be a terrible friend
You remind me of a distant constellation
The way you color it up, but don't let me touch
So now you wanna know is that important
Well maybe now and it just depends, it just depends

And when you come back uptown remember not to look for me there
I give you one more chance to make it better but you don't seem to care
You pretend to be accosted by tradition
And now you cover it up, tell me you don't
Well now you wanna know is nothing sacred
And I don't wanna have to compare, they don't compare

When I see your friends they say it's in my head
All my friends seem to think you might leave me for dead
I don't remember if it's coastal complication
It keeps leaving it out and color it up
And if you wanna know I won't confront you
With all the stupid things that you said
