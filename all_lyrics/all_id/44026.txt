God-brother..... you lie...

When you see a fire burning inside your minds eye
Grieve/Breathe(???) the meaning of the flames before you let them die
Let them burn you through until you know that you can fly
Twisting - turning - falling - burning
Roaring balls of fire
Eyes that see them have no need
Of guides to span the wire
Let the flames burn you right through
To low the burns through higher

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can buy you the morning sun

You can buy seven/sand/sun(???) from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty - the mountain - the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free
Come and see
Come and buy
Come and buy...buy my love

Sleeping sunsets sweat their beauty
Melting at your feet
Take your mind through sacred fire
Leaving you complete

Let the flames burn you so hard
There can be no re-treat
Floating - drooping - looping - turning
Roaring balls of fire
Light the pathway you must take
To drag you from the myre
Sooth the darkness from your feet
Burn down your funeral pyre

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can sell you the morning sun

You can buy seven/sand/sun(???) from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty - the mountain - the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free

Come and see
Come and buy
Buy my fire
Buy my fire

Eyes are glaring on your face
Watching you below
Take the sun that sweats at midnight
Burning you below

See the sun as it sweats with beauty
Burning through the fire
Feeding on your soul - so deep
Fire
Come and buy my
Fire
Come and buy my fire
Come and buy...
Buy my fire...

Why is it so cold down here?
So cold...!!
Let me in...
The price of your entry is sin
Go away - then return
Know which fase you have to turn
Eyes are glaring
Voice's flaring
Woooaaah!
