STOLEN DANCE
I want you by my side
So that I’ll never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from here
I hope they didn’t get your mind
Your heart is too strong Anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
[Chorus] x2
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
Never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
