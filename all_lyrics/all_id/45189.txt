Privileged, a chosen few, blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision, the day we all fell still
Rapture of the dying age, a shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass

Its only getting worse, not worth a moments regret
Each dawn another curse, every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake?

An ill wind blows this way, th edge of the envelope burns
For bearance and my vengeance, payment for your intent
Fear and death in the wings, in thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does, witness the mass disgrace

God forbid you read the signs watch for meanings between the lines
Gehenna has now arrived, no hindsight for the blind
Your trust has been misplaced, believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now its too late

You finally made it home, 
Draped in the flag that you fell for
And so it goes
The ashes of the wake
Its only getting worse...
