Flowing rivers craggy mountains sigh
Wondering, watching as your mind flies by
Get your feet onto the ground better try
Now is the time to free your mind fly fly fly

Hold your head up to the sky,fly high
See the heaven's open doors fly by
Angels hold you near
Now your path is clear
God has cast no fear
Mind fly by

Cast yourself and sail into the sun
You've had your fun
Now your time has come
