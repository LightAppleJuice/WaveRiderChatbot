Between the spaces where we long to be,
Beyond together and alone
And at the edge where you fade into me
We find a shelter we come home
Come home 

Escape the shadows that were holding me
? ? flesh and bone
And in the seconds where we know we're free
This is the place that we call home

When there's nowhere left to run, run with me
Let the moment be a century
When its all that you've become, set it free
Let this moment be a century
