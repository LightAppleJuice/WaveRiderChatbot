On the hard fast train
On the road to gain
Something gets right through to your telling bone
There's a sudden itch
An electric twitch
Sometimes I swear this body's got a mind of its own
This is the naked truth
This is the light
There's only one place left to go
Auberge
Auberge
Auberge
Auberge
You meet a silent type
On a windy trail
With a shiny cloak and an unseen silver dagger
You can talk till you ache
