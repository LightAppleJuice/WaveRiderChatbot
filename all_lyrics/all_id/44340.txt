Lately baby I feel strange
I’m a head case
And maybe baby I need to get away
From this place

There’s no sympathy
I want some sympathy for me
Here come the men in the white suits

They’re coming to take me away from pain

It’s funny honey how I can change
And stay the same
Not even money honey or immense fame
Will kill the pain

There’s no sympathy
I want some sympathy for me
Here come the men in the white suits

They’re coming to take me away from pain
Lock me away and throw away the key
