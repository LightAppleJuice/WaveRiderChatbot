Listen kids, I've got a novel to declare
Yesterday, I met the girl of Lucifer
Special kind of beauty
Like fire in the air

Oh Lucifer tells me
Oh don't touch that girl you
Know she looks to me like "pissy widdy"
You see what I mean

Oh Lucifer tells me
Oh you can't get it for
Show the devil keeps me under control
What's matter with me
Can't you see can't you see

Gonna lose my soul as far as I'm concerned
She's so nice, she dances the way I just prefer
She looks like an angel
My will and my desire

Oh Oh
Know

What's the matter with me

Can't you see can't you see

Lucifer
Lucifer
Tell me why
Face to face

Oh Lucifer tells me
Oh don't touch that girl you
Know the devil keeps me under control
What's matter with me
Can't you see can't you see

Oh Lucifer tells me
Oh don't touch that girl you
Know she looks to me like "pissy widdy"
You see what I mean

Oh Lucifer tells me
Oh you can't get it for
Show the devil keeps me under control
What's matter with me
Can't you see can't you see
