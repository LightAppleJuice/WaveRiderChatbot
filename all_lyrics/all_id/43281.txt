*Rock me after midnight
I wanna be just like a baby
Rock me after midnight
Tell me a fairytale
That love is not for sale
Look at the lives that I live
I'm hooked and the money you give for my love
I'll pay there is no other way
To buy me what ineed to go on
Who knows for how long
*(повтор)
Love is a word I had banned
I mean love like I thought It was meant long ago
Today since you kissed me this way
I know that if I follow you now
l'll find the way out
