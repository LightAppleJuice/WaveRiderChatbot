Now it seems that it ainâ€™t right
Loading silence in my mind
Oh Oh
Classic order of events:
Another day -another chance
Go on oh oh

I'm here any time u kiss me
I'm free any time u fix me
U though can't explain why
I'm still alive
I'm still alive

Baby can't u see me blind
Floating island through your life
Help me out
Help me out
A-ah

I'm here any time u kiss me
I'm free any time u fix me
U though can't explain why
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
