The sun will always shine on you
You turn my ocean deepest blue
I never hide my thoughts from you
You're my deepest blue

If mother nature ever chose the name
I'm sure that she would chose the same
I never hide my thoughts from you
You're my deepest blue

Am I dreaming now
Walking on the moon
And I don't know how to read you baby
Every time I try to move closer

We've only got this time to prove
That together we can make it through
I'll never hide my thoughts from you
You're my deepest blue

If temptration ever came my way
I know the words I'd alway say
I'll never hide my love from you
You're my deepest blue

Am I dreaming now
Walking on the moon
And I don't know how to read you baby
Every time I try to move closer
