with pain in my soul... soul... soul...
I'd rather stay on the line
but wise people say no! no! no!
whenever I hear this song
always makes me wanna cry... cry... cry...
keeps pushing me upside down
and the truth becomes lie... lie... lie...

don't you stand like this i'm drowning
don't pretend to sleep while I'm burning
times get hard - no need to repress me
don't deny we're all just junting for love

I pack all the things at once
so you notice when I'm gone! gone! gone!
in dreams of perfect life there's no place for quiet home... home... home...
whatever goes through your head
secret sorrow gets me down... down... down...
some people don't realise - 
there's more to life than all right all right

don't you stand like this i'm drowning
don't pretend to sleep while I'm burning
times get hard - no need to repress me
don't deny we're all just junting for love
