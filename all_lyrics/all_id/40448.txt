You know I've driven all night,
But the landscape screams your name.
You know I've driven through hell,
Where your face spreads like a flame.
You know the air vents rusted
And the light bulbs blown.
And you're playing tycoon on the telephone,
While I'm playing for time in the midnight hour alone.

I see you're riding through life
On a storm you can't dismount.
You know the number of times
That you hurt me I just lost count.
I know your smiles so warm,
But you're causing grief.
Cause you've taken my tongue
In your flashing teeth.
And you ruined my soul,
Cause your love's still out of reach.

You never say the things that you feel.
I need to work out which emotion is real.
No point in staying when you won't try.
If you don't want me, I gotta know why.
Your love just lingers in a long goodbye.

You know I've driven all night
Just to see your silhouette.
You know I've driven all night,
But I don't have one regret.
I saw the front doors open a projector gleam.
They were playing our past on a naked beam.
You were playing back scenes
Of your triumphs on the screen.

You never say the things that you feel.
I need to work out which emotion is real.
No point in staying when you won't try.
If you don't want me, I gotta know why.
Your love just lingers in a long goodbye.

You know I've driven all night
As the highway melts with fire.
You know I'm driving on ice
As the elements conspire.
You know I've seen the future,
But it's far too soon.
You were dancing alone
On our honeymoon.
And I was dripping with fear
In the scent of your perfume.

You know I've driven all night,
But my love for you won't die.
You know I'm livin' the hell
Of a lover's long goodbye.
