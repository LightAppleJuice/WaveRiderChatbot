I can't believe, I can't deny
I can't conceive what's in your eyes

Another mistake, another regret
Another unwanted cigarette

And do you really like me
Cause 1 and 1 and 1 makes 3

If you don't hear me
Then why should I hear you

I can't walk away
All I can do is say
Better luck next time
The next untouch
The next untouch
The next untouch
The next untouch
The next untouchable

I can't walk away
All I can do is say
Better luck next time
The next untouchable

The next untouchable

The next untouchable

I Feel her
I move her
I believe her?
I see her

And then it comes
I know what to do
Do I feel it pure
Or is that just you

She said again
She said again
She said again
She said again
She said again
She said again
She said again
She said agaaaain

And do you really like me
Cus 1 and 1 and 1 makes 3

If you don't hear me
Then why should I hear you

I can't walk away
All I can do is say
Better luck next time
The next untouch
The next untouch
The next untouch
The next untouch
The next untouchable

I can't walk away
All I can do is say
Better luck next time
The next untouchable

The next untouchable

I Feel her
I move her
I believe her?
I see her
Forget her
Forget her
