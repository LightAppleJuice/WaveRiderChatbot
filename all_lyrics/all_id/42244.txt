It's a heartache,
nothing but a heartache
Hits you when its too late,
hits you when youre down
Its a fools game,
nothing but a fools game
Standing in the cold rain,
feeling like a clown
Its a heartache,
nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break,
then hell let you down
It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
as much as I depended on you
Oh, its heartache,
nothing but a heartache
