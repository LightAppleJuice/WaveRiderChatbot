[Verse 1:]
Check it out ah, ya, ya
From the moment we met, I was breathless
And not asbestos breathless either,
Always, when you least expect it,
Stumble across Rapunzel a Libra,
Couldn't leave, I had to meet her,
Greet the girl of my dreams with a kiss on the hand,
What up? Little magnificent missing a man,
Ran away, like kids to a van (Yeah!)
Gorgeous, walking on water,
Sort of like Erin McNaught, but little shorter,
Wore a Pandora, bought her a charm,
Wasn't short of thought – bit of Paul on her arm,
Calling for calm, we fought, made Iraq
And the border of Jordan a walk in the park,
Jaws of a shark, too hard to break it off,
Fall apart, so I would say:

[Chorus:]
Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
I'm tired of fighting,
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now

[Verse 2:]
And even she could see,
Her love was like a demolition derby,
I was Herbie, the love-bug, swerving,
Cause I work on the road,
She was like Russell the Crow,
A jerk with her phone!
Know that I don't wanna fight –
Another night, chewing off my ear, like Mike,
Another night ruined, I knew it,
Knew you would do it,
Scream when I'm out, like Hewitt,
You were the one, you were the one that ran away,
Like underlay, underlay,
Then break it off, but come running back,
Like baby, I want you back, but don't call me that,
Now baby, baby,
Baby, don't call me baby-baby,
I said, baby-baby, don't call me baby,
Baby-baby

[Chorus:]
Gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
I'm tired of fighting,
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now

[Verse 3:]
Na, I'm just sick of you saying my friends are above you,
You knew, when you were with me,
But you were lost in watching Sex and the City,
And what did you give me?
Your lips moving, but nothing coming out, like Britney!
And, what, did you lose it?
No, trust: every movement watched, like Truman,
Only human, I ain't a saint, but don't cheat when I'm in the game,
And still you know, you know no, you know you don't know me,
Die from the photos I got, like Dodi,
My own Naomi Campbell, I try to help, she fly off the handle:
No more candles, no more dinner, no more, I'm fat
I could look a little thinner,
Where's my Cinderella, my little Bella?
Hard, but I had to tell her, so I'd say, yeah, so I'd say,
I keep tellin' her, I keep tellin' her:

[Chorus:]
Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
I'm tired of fighting,
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now
We ain't going nowhere now
