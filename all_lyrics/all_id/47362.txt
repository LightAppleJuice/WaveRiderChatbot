she was landlocked with her family name 
by the time that i got there
she was in a state
i took her places, it took adjustment 
just being wanted

and we ran before we walked before we crawled before we lay 
swam before she learnt, before she'd even seen the waves 
i want the best and nothing less, i led her out so far
took her deep and let the water have it’s way

i had her hand 
and everything was good 
she could float just like i could 
(she could float just like i could)
on our backs 
and everything was gold
should’ve never let her go
i knew she couldn’t float on her own

closed-eye kisses through one-way glass
she watched her reflection
i watched her fall apart 
she got sicker, she never breathed 
the air like me

now she's wounded and it’s my fault
she had always been so careful
on my sonar, at the bottom 
i will show her to the surface again
