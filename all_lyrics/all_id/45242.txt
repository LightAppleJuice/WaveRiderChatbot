Gather the bones and lay them in the sun in patterns that capture the eye
No one could know, display for everyone the holes in our souls we despise
Timber and stones monumental, remnants frozen in time
Carried alone the burden, knowing it was all we could do to survive

Only embers remain, refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain, black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain

Scatter the dust, what we once held in our hand seems was never at all
Gone in a gust, not ours to understand, an agony perpetual
Holding my breath and close my eyes, for a second I can see you again
Motionless, like that day we lost who we both should have been

Only embers remain, refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain, black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers...

I've been staring at her lying still for so long (she's so still)
Waiting for this endless night to color into dawn (it's never ending)
But it's never lifting, always shifting, no one can breathe
It holds me under, and this drags down you (it drags you down)
This breaks what was made one into two
