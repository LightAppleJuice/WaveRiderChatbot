If I could be you
And you could be me
For just one hour

If you could find a way
To get inside
Each other's mind

If you could see you
Trough my eyes
Instead of your ego

I believe you'd be
Surprised to see
That you've been blind

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now the whole world
You see around you
Is just a reflection

And of karma
Says you be
Just what you saw

So unless you
Lived your life
Of total perfection

You gotta be careful
Of every stone
That you should throw

Have you ever spend the day
Throwing stones
At one another

Cause I don't think
Or wear my heat
The same way you do

Well I maybe
Come in people
But I'm still your brother

And when you strike out
Trying to hurt me
[Its a burning fuse]

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

There are people
On reservations
And out in the ghetto's

And brother there
Before the [grace] of god
Go you and I

If I only
Had the wings
Of a little angel

Don't you know i'd fly
To the top of the mountain
And then I'd cry

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
