I'm lost in conversation
These words are meaningless
Can't seem to find someone to ease my mind

Then you shut down the world for me
You just shut down the world

We just need a little timeout
Some time to waste
Can we stay here in the silence?
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me

Feeling so disconnected
Drowning in human noise
I am surrounded but I'm so alone

Then you shut down the world for me
You just shut down the world

We just need a little timeout
Some time to waste
Can we stay here in the silence?
Just face to face

Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me
Just face to face
Shut down the world for me

Shut down the world for me
Shut down the world for me
Shut down the world for me
Shut down the world for me

We just need a little timeout
Some time to waste
Can we stay here in the silence?
Just face to face (Just face to face)

Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me
Just face to face (Just face to face)
Shut down the world for me
