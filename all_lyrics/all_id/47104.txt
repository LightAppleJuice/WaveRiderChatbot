No, I never had the nerve to tell you,
So I'm saying it now
Every time you walk away,
I am kicking myself
And I know you don't know what you do,
What you do to me, but it hurts like hell
And I know you don't know what you do,
What you do to me, but it hurts like hell

I just hope that someday,
Somebody's gonna break your heart
Gonna break your heart
And then you'll finally see, yeah you're gonna feel
What I always would have felt, would have felt, would have felt

And you can just go on and say it,
I need to hear it, it'd be better for me
At least I know what's stopping you and I'd hear the truth
And I would believe
Yeah then you'd see the light and finally come to my side
Yeah you'd see the light and finally come to my side

I just hope that someday,
Somebody's gonna break your heart
Gonna break your heart
And then you'll finally see, yeah you're gonna feel
What I always would have felt, would have felt, would have felt
And they'll tell you it's not you but they don't wanna ruin
What they know, what they know so well
I just hope that you you're gonna finally feel
What I've always, what I've always felt

I just hope that someday,
Somebody's gonna break your heart, gonna break your heart
And then you'll finally see, yeah you're gonna feel
What I've always felt
And they'll tell you it's not you but they don't wanna ruin
What they know, what they know so well
I just hope that you you're gonna finally feel
What I've always, would have always felt
