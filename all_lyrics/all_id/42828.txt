I'll walk the sunny side of the street
And I'll know you'll step into line
Freestyle ladies ever so neat
They were born under my sign

It's no use making sense of the game
I'd stick to taking it easy
Welcome ladies ever so sweet
You were made just for pleasing

It was right one dark night in around and far
Walk the street take a seat in around a far
Fell the dream want to scream
Your were there seek and stare
See what you have done 

I feel I'm in for some time with you
And I fell it's gonna disturb me
Easy ladies everything's through (with you)
And I know yours gonna hurt me

It was right one dark night in around and far
Walk the street take a seat in around a far
Fell the dream want to scream
Your were there seek and stare
See what you have done
