Em
Now you're sitting at the top of the world,
You can't remember how it was before,
G Em
You think of nothing and it always been the same.
Em
And all those people running around,
G
Doing everything you want and more,
D A Em
You got the money and keep on playing the game.
Chorus
C A(A7) Em
Walking in a diamond rain,
Walking in a diamond rain,
Walking in a diamond rain, feel no pleasure, feel no pain,
Walking in a diamond rain.
Life is a gamble and you're on the streets,
