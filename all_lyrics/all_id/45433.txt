Remember when we used to talk for hours 
It didn't matter what time it was we didn't care 
We we're just on the phone 

Remember when you used to hold my hand 
You didn't care if anybody saw just you and me 
We were just so in the love, yeh 

But now we're strangers 
And now I'm missing you 

Remember when you used to read my mind 
I didn't have to say a word you said it first 
Before it came out of my mouth 

Remember when you used stroke my hair 
When I was stressed and now, you used to say everything would be ok 
And calm me right down, yeh
