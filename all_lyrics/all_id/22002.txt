Possible, that it could all be wonderful
Sweet the sound, as all the stars come crashing down
But I will wait for you, meet me in the blue

Afterglow, some things you just don’t need to know
Came crashin in untill your heart and bruised your shins
But I will wait for you, if you ask me to

The day is callin you, roll and startin new
Wipe you weary eyes and don’t pull out of the sky
Yes the day is callin you... starting new
Out of the sky, sky, sky…

And I will wait for you, if you ask me to
The day is callin you, ...and startin new
Wipe you weary eyes and don’t pull out of the sky
Yes the day is callin you... starting new
