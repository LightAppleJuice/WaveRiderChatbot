I think I should go now
I must leave before my red eyes match the sunrise
No more coffee will put off today

I've stood too long
In the shadow of a doubt I need some sun
It seems that time returns to me once more
But I have less now than before

And when I feel my world falling down
I think of you
I think of you
And when I feel I can breath no more
you speak to me
you speak to me

When the brightest star
Smiled as it squared shoulders with the night
You lit the glowing embers of my own light

Do you know
Your words could drag the moon down from the sky
Seduce my frozen heart with your war cry
You really made me listen for my voice
And I heard millions

And when I feel my world falling down
I think of you
I think of you
And when I feel I can breath no more
you speak to me
you speak to me

When you fell
I saw your visionary thoughts befriend your blood
Crimson lovers drowning in the same flood
I miss the beauty of your young black skin

I thought that freedom
Can only be defined as endless choice
And I only listened to the logic of the loudest voice

But this world
Will be shaken by a whisper
