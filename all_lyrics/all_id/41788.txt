You can boogie like disco, love that disco sound
Turn up the body and move it all around
But don't, don't, don't, don't, don't forget
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't forget

The Stars on '45 keep on turning in your mind
Like 'We Can Work it Out'
Remember 'Twist and Shout'
You still don't 'Tell Me Why' and 'No Reply'
