[Verse 1]
My father was a young man
My mother off the boat
My eyes were fresh at 21
Bruised but still afloat
Our heads have hit the pavement
Many times before
You stroke his face to soothe him
While knowing that there’s more

[Chorus]
Saint Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

[Verse 2]
And no one even told me
The way that you should feel
Tell me did you lose your son?
Tell me did you lose your love?
Cry and burst my deafness, while Trayvon falls asleep
The things that I would do to you
The things that I could do to you

[Chorus]
Saint Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

[Outro]
Nontetha
We heard it all from you
Nontetha
We waited here for you

Nontetha
Kushé-o aw di bodi
Nontetha
Aw di fambul dem?
