Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
La dee da dee dee
La dee da dee daa
Wait till you have reached the age blah blah
History has turned the page blah blah

We still wanna hear a brand new thing uh huh
We still need a song to sing uh huh

And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
La dee da dee dee
La dee da dee daa
Love is the first thing last thing on our mind
From tomorrow till the end of time

And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
La dee da dee dee
La dee da dee daa
We still move to the rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss

And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
La dee da dee dee
La dee da dee daa
The world keeps turning faster everyday (everyday)
We still wanna dance the night away

And the beat goes on (and the beat and the beat)
