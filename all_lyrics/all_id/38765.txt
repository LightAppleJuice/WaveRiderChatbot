You better get up
Mmm, you better get up

You're so close to the fall, too far from my heart
But I'm ready to come take you away, make you my home
I don't care where you're from, and I don't care where we are
As long as you give it your all

So you better get up
Cause you locked down all your love
You better get up
Cause this feeling just ain't enough
All I want is all of you
And all of me is loving you
So you better get up
Cause you locked down all your love

Love, love, love
Ow
Better get up
Aye, aye, aye

I know we're kind of lost, but at least I'm here with you
No matter where we go, we don't look back, this is our home
And if we ever fall, the only way is up
Hey, as long as I give you my all

So you better get up
Cause you locked down all your love
You better get up
Cause this feeling just ain't enough
All I want is all of you
And all of me is loving you
So you better get up
Cause you locked down all your love

Love, love, love
So you better get up
Aye, aye, aye
You better get up, yeah
Aye, aye, yeah

So you better get up
Cause you locked down all your love
You better get up
Cause this feeling just ain't enough
All I want is all of you
And all of me is loving you
So you better get up, oh
Cause you locked down all your love

Oh I don't ever wanna go home
I feel like nothing holds me down, oh
There ain't no better way to do it right
If you keep up, don't you ever let go
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

So you better get up
Cause you locked down all your love
You better get up
Cause this feeling just ain't enough
All I want is all of you
And all of me is loving you
So you better get up, oh
Cause you locked down all your love

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
