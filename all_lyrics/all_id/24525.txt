So go tonight
You know where i am
And by your side
My love is always there
Keepin' us tight
The feeling is right
My love is always there
My love is always there

Look at the beautiful things in the world
That you're bringing to me
All of the colours and rainbows are
Things that i treasure you bring

Look at the days that we shared
And the love that we dared to feel
You were the first that i loved
And my last that i want to leave

So go tonight
You know where i am
And by your side
My love is always there
Keepin' us tight
The feeling is right
My love is always there

Hold on to the good times
When we were part
Now by your side
My love is always there
Keepin' us bright
The feeling is right
My love is always there
My love is always there
