Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on y head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
I want to dive in your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So, baby, talk to me

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
I want to dive in your ocean
Is it raining with you?
