Flew beyond the sun before it was time
Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell
Waiting for you to pull me back in
I almost sat the world in my sights

Close, low bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you I failed?
Tell you I failed

Fallen from grace cause I been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

I tried to bore a hole into the ground
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hand
The eyes of the child see no wrong
Ignorant bliss in

Close, low bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you I failed?
Tell you I failed

Fallen from grace cause I been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost
Fallen from grace cause I been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

Fallen from grace cause I been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost
Fallen from grace cause I been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion
In oblivion
