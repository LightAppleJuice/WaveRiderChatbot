[Chorus 2x]
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady

[Verse 1]
Mama, come here
Approach, appear
Daddy, I'm alone
Cause this house don't feel like home
[Pre-Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go
If you love me, don't let go

[Chorus 2x]
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady

[Verse 2]
Mother, I know
That you're tired of being alone
Dad, I know you're trying
To fight when you feel like flying

[Pre-Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go
If you love me, don't let go

[Chorus 3x]
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
