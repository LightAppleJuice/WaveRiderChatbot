We we're put it down, we could dive
Everything to make us feel alive
We need just our hands to keep us dry tonight

It's when the rain is falling down on me
Every drop could make me feel complete
Now good days are coming, come with me, it's today

We take tonight to break the sky
I don't mind when the rain is coming
Take my love beside your looks
So you can be breathin' under water

Take my love and let it go, flee as you let me go
We'll be breathin' under water
