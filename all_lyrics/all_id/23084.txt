Touch of your skin blurring my vision
Seeing the same film again
Closer you pull me under the table
Sign of how this might end

But if you don't want to hold me
Maybe I could change your mind
Cause I'm waiting
Hesitating
And there's other ways to leave you
But I've only asked for you
As you move your body next to me
There's so much more to lose

Honey, you talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was, all I wanted was
All I wanted was your reconcile
All I wanted was you

Lean in to kiss you, push me away
Carving my name on your wall
Words are like weapons that cut through the truth
I won't remember anything at all

But if you don't want to hold me
Maybe I could change your mind
Cause I'm waiting
Hesitating
And there's other ways to leave you
But I've only asked for you
As you move your body next to me
There's so much more to lose

But if you don't want to hold me
Maybe I could change your mind
Cause I'm waiting
Hesitating
And there's other ways to leave you

There's so much more to lose

Honey, you talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was, all I wanted was
All I wanted was your reconcile
Talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was, all I wanted was
All I wanted was your reconcile
(Oooooh oooooh oooooh oooooh)
(Oooooh oooooh oooooh oooooh)
(Oooooh oooooh oooooh oooooh)
(Oooooh oooooh oooooh oooooh)
All I wanted was
As you move your body next to me
As you move
As you move your body next to me
As you move
As you move your body next to me
As you move
As you move your body next to me
As you move (move, move, move)
As you move

Honey, you talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was
All I wanted was
As you move
As you move
As you move
