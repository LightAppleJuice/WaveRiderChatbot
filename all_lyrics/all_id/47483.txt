Fire, you conduce it 
Like a fuse in my heart 
Inside, flames consume me 
Tearing through every part 

Burn me up and set me free tonight 
Till there's nothing left to identify 
Will I make it out of here alive? 
I can't fight the fire 

Fight flames of fury 
To get to me tonight 
'Cause I need rescuing 
Break on through it to the inside 

Burn me up and set me free tonight 
Till there's nothing left to identify 
Will I make it out of here alive? 
I can't fight the fire
