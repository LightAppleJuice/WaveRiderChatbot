I get the same old dream, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
Thougts like that since our break-up

These four walls are closing inLook at the fix youve put me in

Since youve been gone
Since youve been gone
Im out of my head, cant take it
Could I be wrong, but since youve been gone
You cast a spell, so break it
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Since youve been gone

So in the night I stand beneaht the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, but night-time comes arround to soon
You cant know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just go to show you dont give a damn

If you will come back baby, you know youll never do wrong
