Sing of the wrath that once aroused
Will cause unutterable pain.
Because when you tossed and turned
Your heart got numb.

I hope you run away too soon.

And when in flight terror behind
Sing of your strange and curing tour
You will know you tried too hard, my friend
When the curbstone broke your jaw again.

Hope you run away.
Hope you run away too soon.

All there is is made of iron and tin
And will all just turn to dust again.

Run away too soon!
