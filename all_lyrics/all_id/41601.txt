Burn my lungs on the coal 
Get so high but I feel low 
And I should know to back away 
But only have the strength to stay 

Well you taste like whiskey and you smell like smoke
Drowning in your words as soon as you spoke 
Try to find a different direction 
I'm drawn to you My New Obsession 

No ones taken me away the way you did 
No ones taken me away 
Clouded my mind, my dime, my lime light, delayed me from flight 
Unable to see from wrong to right 
Try to find a different direction 
I'm drawn to you My New Obsession 

Spin my mind round the room
Inhale the bittersweet perfume 
Round here days turn to night and nights turn to day 
Too wrong or too right theres no other way 

Well you taste like temptation, smell like sin 
Looking for a fix to make my blood thin 
Try to find a different direction
I'm drawn to you My New Obsession 

No ones taken me away the way you did 
No ones taken me away 
Clouded my mind, my dime, my lime light, delayed me from flight 
Unable to see from wrong to right 
Try to find a different direction 
I'm drawn to you My New Obsession
